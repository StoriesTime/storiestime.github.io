Autumn pressed close to the house, leaves whispering against each other like a thousand soft-spoken secrets. Above, the stars shimmered brighter than she remembered from any book or evening stroll. She wanted to believe they were whispering to her specifically, as though the universe had finally noticed she was here.</p><p>Her grandmother’s old telescope sat in the corner behind wooden trunks marked “Wishes” and “Not for Touching.” It had been years since her grandmother climbed the attic stairs or sat beside Lira, both of them peering through the cold brass tube. Since her grandmother&rsquo;s mind had begun to fade, Lira was left to wander the house’s dark corners alone, collecting abandoned dreams like stray feathers.</p><p>Like every night, Lira watched the stars dance and dared to dream her own forbidden wishes: she wished her mother were still alive, she wished her father would notice she was more than another shadow, and she wished her grandmother could remember her name. She pressed her palm to the icy glass. Somewhere in the universe, she thought, all lost dreams must go. Stars can’t be selfish—they must keep them all, somehow.</p><p>In the attic’s hush, the silence curled itself into something strange. A star—only a little brighter and closer than the others—winked at Lira from above the spindly pine that hunched behind her house. She blinked. It pulsed again, quicksilver and insistent.</p><p>This was not the usual pattern of starlight. Lira pulled the telescope forward, its tripod legs scratching against the floorboards. Her breath quickened as she angled it at the shimmering point just above the trees. Through the eyepiece, the star shimmered and split itself into a thousand droplets of pale gold, swirling and reforming into a single pinpoint.</p><p>Her ears began to ring—not quite a sound, not quite a thought—like the memory of a lullaby floating up from the attic floorboards.</p><p><em>Are you listening?</em></p><p>Lira jerked back, colliding with the trunk marked “Wishes.” For a moment she considered running, darting down the narrow stairs into the safety of her room, but the curiosity that lived in her heart kept her rooted.</p><p>She pressed her eye to the telescope again.</p><p><em>You have found us, little seeker.</em></p><p>The attic glowed ever so slightly, shadows thinning around the beams, the lace curtains fluttering in a wind she couldn&rsquo;t feel.</p><p>“Who are you?” she whispered.</p><p>The starlight shivered, and Lira heard—felt—an impossible reply: <em>We are the Keepers of Lost Dreams, and in you, a dream burns fiercely, though others have let theirs fade. Few can hear us. Even fewer answer.</em></p><p>Tears pricked her eyes. “Why me?”</p><p><em>Because you still watch the skies and remember.</em></p><p>Lira steadied herself. Surely she was dreaming. Perhaps she had fallen asleep against the cold window, the taste of loneliness conjuring miracles out of moonlight and fatigue.</p><p>She pressed further. “Where do dreams go when people forget?”</p><p><em>Here. We gather them. Every hope cast aside, every wish whispered after midnight, every longing no one else believes survives in our chorus. Lost dreams sing brightest of all. Would you like to hear them?</em></p><p>Lira hesitated—then nodded.</p><p>The attic blurred, spinning softly like she’d stepped inside a snow globe. The windows, the crates, the needlework on her grandmother’s abandoned shawl—all faded and distanced. There was starlight everywhere, soaked into her skin, pulsing with golden warmth.</p><p>She was standing in a field of impossible blue, the sky velvet-black overhead. Everywhere pinpricks of light hovered, some tangled together in braids, others swirling alone. Each one hummed a gentle note, some low and mournful, some bright as laughter.</p><p>These, Lira realized, were the dreams: not lost at all, not truly gone, just waiting.</p><p>She stepped forward, instinctively reaching for the closest light. It curved toward her, brushing her palm—not a star, but a memory. In it, she saw her mother’s face, young and laughing, showing her how to braid daisy chains, how to invent stories about animals in the clouds: a dragon curled into sleep, a fox trailing stars behind his tail.</p><p>Another light shimmered close, and the voice of her grandmother spilled out: lullabies, the crackle of old records, the taste of vanilla cookies still warm from the oven.</p><p>She reached for more, greedy now, and the lights swarmed around her. With every touch, she was filled with fragments—bits of unused music, unfinished paintings, a child’s wish for a friend, a boy’s hope of flying, a woman’s longing for forgiveness. The air vibrated, fuller than any sky she had ever known.</p><p><em>You hear them well,</em> the voice of the star returned. <em>But what will you do? Dreams cannot simply be stored. They must be shown, shared, or believed in anew. Without dreamers, we fade. Will you be our Dreamkeeper, Lira? Will you show the world what they have forgotten?</em></p><p>Lira’s heart hammered with joy and sorrow in equal measure. “But I’m just a girl. I can’t fix everything.”</p><p><em>No one asked you to fix. Only to remember. Only to share.</em></p><p>The field of dreams hummed encouragement, buoying her with warmth she had not felt in years.</p><p>Lira closed her eyes and nodded. “Teach me.”</p><hr><p>Days turned strange, as if the attic’s magic had followed her down the stairs. She woke with the taste of starlight on her tongue and the hum of forgotten melodies in her ears. When her father muttered about lost keys or jobs undone, she offered quiet comfort and noticed how his eyes softened. When her grandmother stared blankly at the wall, Lira brushed her hair and told her stories—old stories, new stories, some stitched from the dreams she had gathered.</p><p>She began to write, scrawling down every dream she could piece together, sometimes inventing endings for those that seemed unbearably sad. At school, she whispered fragments of possibilities to classmates: <em>You could draw that picture. You could sing in front of the class. You could forgive your friend.</em></p><p>And slowly, she saw changes: her classmates smiled more easily, her grandmother giggled at forgotten jokes, her father lingered at the table to hear her stories before leaving for work. They, in turn, began to share their own fragments—hopes they thought too small or silly to matter—until the house itself seemed to fill with a light invisible to everyone but Lira.</p><p>But keeping dreams is not without cost. Some nights, the attic felt heavier, the gathered dreams clamoring to be seen and heard. Lira sometimes wept for hopes that might never be reborn—a dancer’s ruined ankle, an inventor’s blueprint left in a desk drawer, a mother’s wish to see her child again.</p><p>On winter solstice, the stars called her again, brighter and nearer than before. She stood beneath the old pine behind her house, the snow crisp and hushed. The brightest star flickered—then fell, trailing sparks that faded into the cold.</p><p><em>Not all dreams are meant to come true,</em> the star told her, <em>but none are ever wasted. Every hope echoes, every longing feeds the next dreamer. Even you, Lira. Especially you.</em></p><p>Lira wept then—for her mother, for the dreams she could not save—but also for all the new possibilities woven into the dawn.</p><hr><p>Years passed. The little girl who watched the stars grew tall and wise, her hair sweeping her shoulders in wild, dark waves. She became a storyteller, then a teacher, then something between—a weaver of hope for every child who felt invisible.</p><p>Each night, she climbed to the attic and listened. Some dreams she let out—releasing them like birds into the evening. Others she gently coaxed awake in those around her. Sometimes, she simply held them close for a while, adding warmth until they could fly on their own.</p><p>Those who met Lira always felt as if their lives, too, glimmered a little brighter, like stars remembering to speak after years of silence.</p><p>Long after her own hair turned silver, Lira’s name lived on in the stories she shared and the dreams she inspired. The stars, ever patient, waited overhead—singing with a trillion lost hopes, each echoing the courage of a girl who once dared to listen when the world fell silent.</p><p>And those who watched the night sky closely, on a clear, lonely evening, sometimes swore they heard a quiet voice in the starlight:</p><p><em>We are the Keepers of Lost Dreams. Listen well, Dreamer—for we speak only to those who remember how to wish.</em></p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/magical-realism/>Magical Realism</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/stars-in-her-eyes/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Stars in Her Eyes</span>
