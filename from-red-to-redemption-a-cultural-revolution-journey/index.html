A red poster with Chairman Mao’s stern face pressed against the glass, crumpled at the corners. Liying lay curled on her mat, listening to the wind howl against the collective’s brick walls and considering, not for the first time, what it meant to be seventeen and wear a red scarf in Beijing in 1968.</p><p>The past year had torn old maps to shreds. Her father, who had been a history professor, vanished in the spring—taken for “thought reform.” Liying had long since stopped asking the cadre teachers where he’d gone. In their faces, she could discern nothing but pity, unease, and the clumsy armor of self-preservation.</p><p>She turned the red armband in her hands. She was officially a Red Guard, but the status felt so thin, a ribbon stretched across a vast, forbidden chasm. She never shouted as loudly as the others—not during their “loyalty dances,” and certainly not at the public struggle sessions where neighbors accused neighbors. It wasn’t in her to spit at people, even if her own name was safer if she joined in.</p><p>Today the class had been called into the quadrangle for a new reading. Rumor crackled through the school like static electricity. “It’s another manifesto,” someone whispered, doomed to memorize it by day’s end.</p><p>But the man who arrived didn’t carry sheets of revolutionary literature. He was shabbily dressed, a peasant with hands rough from village work. He stood, elbows in, and coughed—a dry, frightened sound—before he spoke.</p><p>“My name is Liu Chao,” he announced. “I come to speak about my ‘ideological transformation.’”</p><p>The supervisor, a severe-faced woman in arm-length gloves, nodded from the edge of the crowd. Liu Chao swallowed visibly. “I believed in old ideas,” he admitted. “About family property, education, what makes someone upper or lower class.”</p><p>A handful of Red Guards scoffed. Liying felt the sick tension of performance in her chest; one word out of line, and you were marked.</p><p>The man’s eyes lifted. Something flashed in them. “But the village is different now,” he said. “We share the land. We stand in line for our rice. I help fix the irrigation instead of looking out for my family only. Maybe I have more to offer the people than I thought.”</p><p>His story, awkward and strange, opened a rift in Liying’s mind. Who had he been before, and who was he now? By official standards, Liu Chao was reformed—once an “enemy,” now a participant. Yet, his story was hesitantly told, bits and pieces trailing off for lack of words.</p><p>After the assembly, Liying drifted through the hallways. Outside, the rain had stopped. She imagined her father—where did he sleep? Did he kneel on a cold factory floor, scrawling endless confessions? Or had he managed a cell with a rat for company, his only asset the sharpness of memory and the quiet pride of a teacher’s mind?</p><p>That evening, Liying returned to her dorm, but sleep refused her. She reached beneath her pillow for her secret notebook—the one with linens from Haidian wrapped around its cover. She wrote in cramped lines: <em>What is it, to be remade? Should I want this? Has my father been unmade?</em></p><hr><p>Winter approached. Coal smoke choked the air at dawn, and announcements echoed over broken loudspeakers: new directives, new accusations, new demands for revolutionary purity. Liying&rsquo;s friend, Yuxuan, carried a battered violin. Their shared secret—music—bound them closer than shared ideology ever could.</p><p>“I’ve lost my uncle,” Yuxuan whispered one gray afternoon, hunched behind a hedge. “I think—he’s with your father.”</p><p>They dared, weeks later, to wander the abandoned library at dusk. Through dusty doors, they found shelves half bare, books with torn spines. Holding flashlights wrapped in handkerchiefs, they snuffed the beams across the classics deemed “counterrevolutionary”: Confucius, Laozi, even old novels.</p><p>Liying traced characters on the brittle cover of an anthology. “We’re not bad, are we?” she whispered.</p><p>Yuxuan’s answer was a strangled laugh. “Define ‘bad.’”</p><hr><p>In the new year, a commune official posted lists outside the sleeping quarters. “Re-education through labor,” the posters read. Mao’s red handwriting—looping and bold—cautioned all against bourgeois tendencies. The students would be sent to villages across the country to learn from the peasants. For Liying and Yuxuan, destiny had arrived in the form of assignment slips stamped with the local Party seal.</p><p>Their train rattled north, past the walls of fading imperial palaces, through valleys where color bled from the earth, and into Hebei Province. The terrain unfolded in endless brown. Liying felt stripped, exposed in the countryside. There was no shelter of crowds, no hiding in plain sight. Day after day, she bent at the waist to plant rice seedlings. Her fingers cracked and bled. The work was rhythm, pain, penance.</p><p>Yet, villagers invited the students into their homes, sharing millet porridge and tales of hardship. An old woman, her back bent so deeply she seemed almost a shape from the earth itself, told Liying about her youth—how soldiers had come, how land had changed hands, how she’d buried two sons and survived every famine.</p><p>“You are from the city,” the old woman observed, not unkindly. “You think twice before you speak. Here, words cost the speaker, too, but we use them like water.”</p><p>That night, Liying walked to the edge of a frozen pond. She dug up a stone and hurled it, hard, into the dark. She wanted to find what the old woman meant, that cost and that courage.</p><hr><p>Over the months, city-bred Red Guards like Liying learned to sow and to harvest, to coax seedlings from ice and to mend walls abandoned by memory. At dusk, they sometimes gathered in circles around the fading heat of charcoal braziers. The official rhetoric—class struggle, revolution, endless vigilance—wore thin. In its place grew quieter things: gratitude for laughter, for honest labor, for stories offered without suspicion.</p><p>One March morning, a rumor flickered through the rice paddies: policy was shifting in Beijing. “The end of chaos!” a courier hollered as he cycled down the main road, waving a fresh newspaper. “Officials say study and work can be balanced again. Some will go home soon!”</p><p>Yuxuan grinned, though her hands were raw. She and Liying pressed their gloved palms together. “Maybe your father will come home. Maybe your life will start again.”</p><p>But if Beijing called, would she jump to return? Under rural stars, in bitter cold and mosquito-thick summer, Liying had found redemption not in doctrine, but in the resolute, persistent pulse of daily life. She could never unsee hardship, or the old woman’s soft wisdom. She could not erase the shame of earlier betrayals, nor the compassion she’d grown to feel, even for those she’d feared.</p><hr><p>Liying returned home with the first thaw. Her city, battered by change and memory, felt at once alien and familiar. Apartment staircases stubbornly squeaked. Mothers argued about rations in the street. Paint on every wall still flaked red, but young people’s faces hinted at fresh colors beneath the surface.</p><p>One evening, a letter found her—a plain envelope, characterless, but with her father’s handwriting inside. The lines were cautious, trained by redemption campaigns and years of careful speech.</p><p><em>I am alive. I am teaching now in a small town near the river. Truth is not in books alone. Someday, you will come to understand.</em></p><p>Liying pressed the letter to her lips. She looked at her reflection in the train window on yet another outbound journey, this time of her own choosing. She traced the city lights receding into darkness and thought of all the red: flags, posters, armbands, and the persistent tint on her palms from muddy fields far away.</p><p>What she saw now was not color at all, but a kind of illumination—fragile, restless, and real. Redemption, she decided, was less about erasing the past than living through it with eyes open.</p><p>Even the red, she realized, could be outgrown.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/cultural-revolutions/>Cultural Revolutions</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/from-past-to-present-short-stories-reflecting-cultural-revolutions/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>From Past to Present: Short Stories Reflecting Cultural Revolutions</span>
