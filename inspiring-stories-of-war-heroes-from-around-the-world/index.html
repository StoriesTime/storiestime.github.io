Using a burning tank destroyer&rsquo;s machine gun, he repelled the attack until reinforcements arrived. His actions earned him the Medal of Honor and numerous other decorations.</p><p>Murphy&rsquo;s story resonates beyond his battlefield exploits. After the war, he became an advocate for veterans&rsquo; mental health, openly discussing his struggles with post-traumatic stress disorder—a condition often stigmatized at the time. In doing so, he helped shift public perception and bring light to the invisible wounds of war.</p><hr><h2 id=2-noor-inayat-khan-the-courageous-spy-of-wwii>2.

Despite the constant threat of capture, which could mean torture and death, she refused to abandon her post.

With minimal equipment and enduring brutal cold, Häyhä reportedly achieved over 500 confirmed kills in less than 100 days.</p><p>Dubbed &ldquo;The White Death&rdquo; by enemies for his camouflage and silent lethality, Häyhä’s effectiveness was key to the Finnish defensive tactics.
