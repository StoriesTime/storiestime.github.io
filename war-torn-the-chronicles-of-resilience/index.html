He was a skilled horseman, a talented painter, and a devoted husband to his lovely wife, Fatima. Akram's days were filled with tending to his family's livestock and working on his latest art piece. The year was 2023, and the world beyond his village seemed to be at peace. But that was about to change.
Chapter 2: The Rumors Begin
As the summer months approached, rumors began to circulate about a ruthless armed group, known as the Red Hand, that was terrorizing local villages in the nearby region. The Red Hand was notorious for their brutality, committing heinous crimes against innocent civilians and soldiers alike. Akram dismissed the rumors as mere hearsay, but his father, a wise and experienced man, sensed that something was amiss.
"Hasten the change of life, my son," his father had cautioned. "These are not ordinary times. We must be prepared."
Chapter 3: The Arrival of Red Hand
One sweltering July day, the Red Hand arrived in the village, leaving a trail of destruction and chaos in their wake. Akram's tranquil life was shattered as the villains stormed into the village, firing their guns and setting fire to homes. Panic gripped the villagers, and Akram's family scrambled to find safety.
"We have nothing to fear," Fatima whispered to Akram, clutching his hand tight. "We will face whatever comes, together."
But their efforts were futile. Red Hand's soldiers tore through the village, executing anyone who resisted, and deporting the women and children. Akram watched in horror as his family's home was set ablaze.
Chapter 4: Loss and Revenge
In a desperate bid to save his family, Akram fled the village, but he soon discovered that his wife, Fatima, and their newborn baby were nowhere to be found. Consumed by grief and anger, Akram joined a group of rebels determined to fight the Red Hand and put an end to their tyranny. The group, known as the Free Warriors, trained Akram in guerrilla warfare and surviving in the wilderness.
"We will not lose what is rightfully ours," their leader said, gazing into Akram's determined eyes. "We will fight until the Red Hand is brought to justice."
Akram's newfound friendship with the Free Warriors fueled his desire for revenge, but as they journeyed across the war-torn landscapes, he began to realize the true cost of conflict.
The human suffering, the broken dreams, and the scars that time refused to heal were forever etched in their minds, reminding him that the outcome of his actions would forever affect the world.
Chapter 5: The Turning Point
As Akram delved deeper into the world of warfare, he encountered something unexpected: himself. He caught glimpses of the life he had before the Red Hand's arrival in his village, but also the fragments of his current reality where life became worth living when every day was a battle for survival.
Akram lost sleep over the atrocities he carried out against innocent Red Hand soldiers. They looked like his own people— famished and desperate young soldiers caught in a machine they could neither control nor understand.
And then, something shifted inside him. He began questioning his mission and its justification. In the face of such chaos, could it be possible to find redemption? Or would the spirit of revenge ultimately consume him?
Chapter 6: Choices of Heart
It was during one fateful shoot-out on a desolate hillside that Akram encountered Ruzhou, a young child with a weary, crimson-stained gaze. Caught in the midst of a raging battle, she stood beside a lifeless Red Hand soldier, clutching a shiny object – a torn locket bearing a part of a photograph of Akram's family.
Time seemed to slow down as all that appeared in his gaze was Ruzhou, their conflicting histories no longer paramount. That gaze forced him to snap back to reality. The little girl reminded him of what the war had taken from him and how it should never dictate who to be. Akram made a choice then – to leave the Free Warriors and forge his own path - to fight for peace, not for vengeance.
"Mama came back today," Ruzhou sobbed.
Fatima, his beloved wife, had returned, found by a brave group of hunters heading towards his hometown. Vast uncertainty greeted Akram as his existence up until that point revolved around her, now torn between taking the route to recovery and further nurturing the hatred that built during these fierce tumultuous years.
In trying to understand the cruel cycles of war and the hurt of loss, courage and forgiveness ignited the true beginning, as more people he wished to call friends started reflecting the possibility that peace – like the dawn - would rise from a resolute commitment of effort to hold on to its beauty.
The conflict would one day seem very different. But Akram decided on that hill to bring hope back.
While working towards the impossible and difficult for his family, he struggled between his resolve to go on protecting their future over all else. For his family's sake he declared on this harsh war-ravaged road a story - the foundation stone - and the history building ever after towards one word:
