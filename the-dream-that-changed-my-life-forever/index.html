The rumbling of traffic outside my apartment window mingled with the occasional patter of rain against glass, weaving a lullaby I’d been unable to appreciate for months.</p><p>Sleep had become an elusive animal since Mara left. Some nights, I wondered if it was even necessary, or if I had simply convinced myself that a few hours of silence would suffice in place of rest. But this night, in that narrow corridor just beyond consciousness, I fell. Not gracefully, more as if I’d stepped off something solid only to find nothing below.</p><p>When my feet found purchase, it wasn’t my threadbare carpet. I stood atop stone—ash-gray, cold, and wet beneath my bare soles. There was a mist swirling about my ankles, rolling in thick, ghostly waves. Some primal instinct prodded my senses; I was dreaming, but more awake than I had felt in weeks.</p><p>I felt compelled forward, into a forest that pulsed faintly with a blue, phosphorescent light. The trees stretched impossibly high, their trunks so straight and uniform they resembled the pipes of a cathedral organ. Branches tangled overhead, and I could not see the sky—only that floating radiance, a constellation of distant lights hovering midair.</p><p>As I walked, memories blurred at the edges, flickering into focus and then dissolving. Mara’s laughter echoed faintly, more a sensation than a sound. I tried following the path, but it wound unpredictably, sometimes vanishing altogether, forcing me to pick my way between silent trees.</p><p>Eventually, the wood opened onto a clearing, circular and perfect, the grass inside pressed down in a spiral as if something vast had turned in place. There in the center stood a solitary figure: a woman clothed in a gown shimmering with the silver of moonlit water, her face hidden in shadow.</p><p>I felt hesitant, but drawn irresistibly forward. With each step, the grass under my feet pulsed, alive with tiny motes of that luminescent blue.</p><p>“Who are you?” I asked, though my voice sounded distant—a memory of itself.</p><p>The woman tilted her head, hair cascading over her shoulder like a soft current of ink. “You know who I am, even if you don’t remember,” she replied. Her voice was strange, layered with echoes, as if different speakers overlapped on the same line.</p><p>I tried to move closer, but the world rippled, the trees on the far side flickering as if reality were a poorly tuned radio. “Why are you here?” I asked.</p><p>She extended a hand, long fingers unfolding gracefully, beckoning. “To remind you.”</p><p>The words ricocheted through my mind, stirring images from what felt like other lives. Schoolyards, fluorescent-lit offices, quiet evenings curled on a sofa—moments I’d let slip by in the service of someday, always promising myself that joy could be scheduled, that contentment would come after this meeting, that deadline, that next impossible goal.</p><p>“What do you want from me?” My voice wavered, the dream pressing on me with the gravity of oceans.</p><p>“Do you think this is about want?” she said, voice suddenly crystalline. “You forget. You always forget.”</p><p>Something sharp twisted in my chest—a truth too long ignored. I’d spent half my life searching for meaning in accolades, expecting someone else, some event, to bestow satisfaction on me from outside. But every major milestone had faded as quickly as it had arrived, replaced by new anxieties. I’d allowed myself to become a passenger.</p><p>“I don’t want to forget,” I whispered.</p><p>She stepped forward into the soft glow. Her face now was Mara’s, eyes luminous, not accusing but filled with an infinite sadness. “Then remember me not as a loss, but as a path.”</p><p>And, at once, the dream narrowed, the forest falling away. I stood with Mara at a train station, the bitter cold stinging my cheeks. She smiled, uncertainty written in the lines around her eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Life,&rdquo; she said quietly, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t as long as you think, Simon. Don&rsquo;t wait until it&rsquo;s quiet to find happiness. Make the noise yourself.&rdquo;</p><p>I tried to speak—apologize, maybe thank her, maybe just say goodbye with more grace than I had—when the whistle of the departing train drowned my words. As the train slid from view, she waved, then vanished, leaving me with nothing but the shivering ache of memory.</p><p>The dream dissolved, spinning me gently from that dream train platform back through the blue-lit woods, through waking darkness, and finally into my bed, heart hammering beneath the rustle of sheets.</p><hr><p>When I woke, the first light of dawn filtered through rain-streaked glass, painting the walls buttery gold. I lay still, letting details of the dream settle like dust in my mind. There was a weight to it—a sense of revelation, not fully understood, but pressing all the same.</p><p>The old instinct to roll over, check my phone, fill my mind with quick distractions, was almost overwhelming. Instead, I sat up, swinging my legs over the side of the bed. The apartment felt different. The air, sharper. A thread of determination wound through the routine haze—subtle, but insistent.</p><p>Without fully knowing why, I brewed a pot of coffee and opened the window, letting the city’s morning sounds drift in. Pigeons fighting for territory. The hum of distant traffic. I sat with my mug cradled in my hands, letting the heat seep back into me. For the first time in months, I resisted the urge to post some glib, self-effacing comment online about my insomnia.</p><p>Instead, I reached for a notebook I’d left buried under old mail and scribbled a single phrase: &ldquo;Don’t wait for the quiet.&rdquo;</p><p>Outside, the world began its frantic pace, unbothered by my revelation. Yet everything had shifted, if only a fraction—a sliver of brightness widened by the memory of a dream.</p><p>Work was the same frenetic sprint it had always been, but I found myself pausing, noticing small moments I’d let slip by before. I sent an email to an old friend I’d lost touch with, suggesting coffee. When my boss offloaded another project on me, I didn’t grind my teeth and stew; I asked her, bluntly but kindly, to clarify the priorities, sharing how things were stacking up. There was an awkward pause, but she admitted she’d lost track herself, and thanked me.</p><p>At lunch, I stepped outside instead of eating at my desk. The city, usually a gray blur, shimmered in the aftermath of the rain. I walked to the little park nearby and sat on a damp bench, watching pigeons pick at sandwich crusts around my shoes.</p><p>I found myself thinking of Mara—not in the jagged, heart-bruised way of recent weeks, but as that gentle face in the clearing, reminding me of who I’d been before ambition and disappointment had pruned away joy. “Don’t wait for the quiet. Make the noise yourself.” It haunted me, lifted me. The simple resonance of her words echoed whenever I found myself on the verge of stepping aside, letting another day slide past.</p><p>Over the next weeks, the dream’s echo grew louder. I signed up for a painting class—something I’d wanted since college, dismissing it as impractical, self-indulgent. The first brushstroke felt awkward, but as the colors blurred across canvas, a slow smile crept up my face.</p><p>I called my mother—not a perfunctory check-in, but a winding conversation about childhood, regrets, recipes gone wrong. We laughed harder than either of us had in years.</p><p>I found myself saying yes more easily: yes to the friend who needed help moving apartments, yes to the neighbor who wanted a dog-sitter, yes to the small acts of inconvenience that, somehow, left me lighter rather than drained.</p><p>One night, lying in the blue glow of early morning, I realized I was no longer waiting for life to begin, or for the world to finally quiet down and grant me permission to be happy. Opportunity, I finally understood, isn’t a knock on the door. Sometimes, you have to build the door yourself.</p><p>The dream changed my life not with thunder or spectacle, but with a hushed clarity that settled into every choice: the decision to be present, to shape gratitude from fragments, to recognize joy as something we create, not simply receive.</p><p>In the months that followed, Mara’s voice softened in my memory, entwined with the voice that emerged from within. “Remember me as a path.” The forest, the clearing, the phosphorescent light—these lingered, but what endured most was the sensation of walking forward, awake, with my feet pressing into the world, alive and certain as the brightening sky.</p><p>And so I walk—sometimes hesitantly, sometimes purposefully—into mornings stitched with possibility, carrying with me that single whisper from the heart of a dream:</p><p>Don’t wait for the quiet. Make the noise yourself.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/dreams-and-aspirations/>Dreams and Aspirations</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-dream-keepers-tales-of-hope-and-vision/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Dream Keepers: Tales of Hope and Vision</span>
