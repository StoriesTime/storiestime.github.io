Time was supposed to be perfect and predictable under his esteemed tutelage, but ever since the latest hiccup—an unfortunate and mysterious event which caused moments in her life to shift out of order—she had been struggling to keep track of daily tasks, let alone her future. The once eminent scientist who revolutionized clocks across the realm had recently lost control, and time itself now seemed to wobble, threatening to unravel even the most tightly knotted life plans.</p><p>&ldquo;Professor Shiftwell, sir?&rdquo; Tara called out timidly as she swung open the heavy oak door. She had to speak barely above a whisper. The room was smaller than she&rsquo;d anticipated, and the man himself, once an impressive figured with piercing eyes framed by an aura of powerful innovation, now hunched over a cluttered desk. A mass of tangled wires and clocks adorned the surface, none of them working properly.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, Tara!&rdquo; the professor shouted, startling her. He leaned back in his creaky chair, which groaned in protest. A cloud of dust swirled around him as his hand found its way through tousled gray hair. &ldquo;About time you came to see me, my dear. Time is ever messenger of our woe,&rdquo; he muttered, hiccuping right on cue.</p><p>Embarrassed, Tara coughed into her hand. &ldquo;Yes, sir. I&rsquo;ve been having some&mldr; issues with time,&rdquo; she replied, lamely trying to hide her fluster by brushing imaginary dust off her jeans.</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me nothing new,&rdquo; rumbled Professor Shiftwell sarcastically. He gestured towards a particularly uncontrollable clock, its hands spinning in a dizzying dance. " Issues with time are all I have left now," he sighed and took a swig from an old bottle of coffee, its aroma competing with the strong scent of aging leather from his coat. With a dramatic flourish of his arm, he scooped a handful of papers from the desk with a flourish.</p><p>Tara glanced down at the stack of papers already littering the floor. She couldn&rsquo;t help but notice they were dated multiple times, some pages bearing different days and months. Tara heaved a deep breath, then plucked her courage. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve experienced a hiccup, sir,&rdquo; she explained uncertainly.</p><p>The professor stared at her with bloodshot eyes. &ldquo;Of course you have,&rdquo; he groaned, burying his face in his hands. &ldquo;Everybody&rsquo;s experiencing a hiccup. Damn Shiftmancy. It&rsquo;s chaos! Absolute chaos!&rdquo; His chair creaked as he stood up abruptly and shuffled to the small window, peering out at the madness of the world swirling beyond. Buildings that were once clearly there now seemed hazy, their Positions switching erratically.</p><p>&ldquo;At first, I thought it was just in my head,&rdquo; Tara ventured timidly. &ldquo;But&mldr; things from different points of time have started happening out of order.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Projected time lines are collapsing like yesterday&rsquo;s pie crust,&rdquo; the professor said sadly, sounding like a madman. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the nature of Shiftmancy, yet perhaps it might also hold the solution. You&rsquo;ve had your hiccups, Tara?&rdquo; he asked, turning to face her.</p><p>Tara nodded. &ldquo;Yes, sir. It&rsquo;s still hard to explain.&rdquo; She wrung her hands together. &ldquo;First, I remember packing for a vacation I was supposed to take last summer. Then, a strange older version of myself asked when I was going to quit looking so nervous. Lastly, there was the day I saved a child from a runaway carriage. But the proudest moment — I couldn&rsquo;t find those memories again, professor.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, child,&rdquo; the professor said, going back to his chair, &ldquo;You surely have a magical grip on matters most chaotic. Tell you what, my dear. Let&rsquo;s take a journey together.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A journey? Professor Shiftwell, sir—&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To find the root of the time ripples and stabilize them,&rdquo; he insisted, pushing a slightly wonky timepiece into her hands. &ldquo;Wear this, and try not to get lost, will you? Just focus on being strong.&rdquo;</p><p>And with that, Tara found herself outside the door of the Professors Shiftwell’s office again, clutching the mysterious timepiece. She sighed, mounting her steed, AnApple, and took off at full gallop. The world shimmered around her as she strove to find control within the chaos.</p><p>Days later, both Tara and Professor Shiftwell managed to trace the beginnings of the time ripple back to the sources responsible: three rogue spells in a hidden library. Every time one of the spells were cast incorrectly, a distortion was created in the time-lines of the world, which weakened the structure of time itself. Those very rogue spells drew energy from the once powerful and consistent time energy of the realm.</p><p>The journey brought them changes unlike any they had comprehended. Tara discovered the strength she had yearned for, and Professor Shiftwell regained his old fire and dedication to his work. With those deeper understandings, they faced the last of their quests, the rescuse of the time.</p><p>In the ancient library, they finally confronted the enigmatic sorceress, Mistress Chaos herself, who had deliberately carried out the mischievous spells long abandoned by others. Tara, driven by the raw courage she had always harbored, put her heart into the fight. Side by side, she and the professor sought to master the darkness that had been forged and to quench the chaos of the hiccups.</p><p>With a deep sigh, Tara untangled the last rogue spell from around her legs as she found herself back in the professor&rsquo;s cluttered room. She paused, considering her next words carefully. &ldquo;We did it, Professor. We&rsquo;ve stopped the hiccups,&rdquo; she said with quiet conviction, an air of determination in her voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; the professor whispered, staring at Tara. As he leaned on his chair, it creaked furiously under his weight, but this time not with protest, but with excitement. &ldquo;The genius lies in the timing.&rdquo;</p><p>Tara smiled and took a seat with the best guidance she could. And they stayed up for hours, sharing a feast of roasted chestnuts and warm mulled wine, plotting their futures, now solidified in the past, present, and future as one. They marveled at the very seams of time they&rsquo;d mended, the ripples they&rsquo;d still standing, and the praise they received across the land.</p><p>Tara went on to study under the guidance of Professor Shiftwell, blending her creativity with the volatile waters of time to create new and extraordinary morsels of existence. She and the professor walked their terrestrial sphere with wisdom, and their names were recorded in the chronicles of their world for all time. They were not the last of their kind, but they had roots and a foundation within those fluctuating realities. As time itself flickered and danced, Tara and Professor Shiftwell became emblems of the human spirit—the unyielding need to adapt, find a foothold in the strange and fantastic, and always, always strive for order within the chaos.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/time-travel-and-alternate-realities/>Time Travel and Alternate Realities</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/shattered-timelines-tales-of-time-travel-and-parallel-universes/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Shattered Timelines: Tales of Time Travel and Parallel Universes</span>
