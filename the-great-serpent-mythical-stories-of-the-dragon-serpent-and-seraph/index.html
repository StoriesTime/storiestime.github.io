Hearing the stories told by their elders, children would huddle close, wide-eyed and breathless, as the fires cast flickering shadows that danced across the ancient stone walls of the village hall.</p><p>As myth was to legend, the tale of the Great Serpent eventually became an integral part of the village identity. It had been said that eons ago, the Great Serpent, a fearsome yet wise creature possessing the essence of both beast and spirit, rose from the depths of Oblivia Ocean to forge its lair within the mountain of Vrear.</p><p>Then, there came the Elders who claimed to have caught but a glimpse of the mighty Serpent&rsquo;s luminescent scales, a glistening swath of iridescent emerald and vivd azure that dazzled the senses and pierced the night like golden beams of celestial light.</p><p>Living on the very pinnacle of that mountain, the Great Serpent had two objectives in its existence. First, to protect its den and those who dwelled within it, assuming the role of a fearsome guardian destined to maintain balance and order; maintaining peace and balance for those beyond the veil of its domain. Second, the Serpent had inherited the secret knowledge of the Ancient Sages - an ancient prophecy revealing a catastrophic cataclysm destined to befall the world in the distant future.</p><p>In an attempt to prevent this inevitable doom, the Great Serpent disseminated its wisdom through a trio of protectors, mystical beings born of a fiery breath of heaven: the Dragons of Fire, the Serpent of the Sea, and the Seraph of the Sky. As long as they upheld the Serpent&rsquo;s ancient council and adhered to the teachings of the prophecy, the creatures of Terros would continue to flourish undisturbed.</p><p>The tale unfolded as the Spirits of the Waters revealed themselves in the form of the Serpent of the Sea, a being of unimaginable beauty that traversed the vast oceans in search of wisdom and truth. With clinched teeth and swirling emerald eyes, the Serpent would warn the people of impending doom and entreat them towards redemption.</p><p>Of a similar breed, the Dragons of Fire relentlessly roamed the world, imbibing the flames of Terra in pursuit of knowledge. Stationed high atop Mount Ignis, the mighty Dragons would impart wisdom by releasing rivers of fire, illuminating the darkest corners of their realm.</p><p>Ascending to the mighty stratosphere, the Seraph of the Sky descended upon the world in radiant brilliance, bearing witness to the eons of time with dazzling speeds. Frenetically flapping, the Seraphir transformed the very sky, creating a kaleidoscope of colors in acknowledgment of the Great Serpent&rsquo;s divine wisdom.</p><p>Indeed, the inhabitants of Serpentara knew of none other than the almighty Seraphim, the pillar of morality, the bearer of the word. Guiding their souls toward solace, the seraphs brought forth hope to the souls in despair, offering eternal solace through their wisdom.</p><p>As the years went by, these beings resulted to guardianship to maintain the Sacred Pact, vowing to uphold the spoken words of the Serpent and evacuate the world before succumbing to the ominous cataclysm. Not even the Great Serpent knew when the event would strike or how it would transpire but understood that to preserve its realm from the very brink of darker forces that could necessitate its sacrifice.</p><p>For centuries, the Dragons of Fire ignited the hearts of their kin and forced them to face their fears to pursue knowledge at any expense. Meanwhile, the Serpent of the Sea breathed life into the sea, imbuing residents with its endless wisdom. The Seraph of the Sky guided the skies, urging the world to seek enlightenment in each fleeting moment.</p><p>Thus commences the narrative, an eternal bond between the Serpent, the constructs of wisdom, and Seraph. Through the prosperity and dark chapters in the chronicles of folklore, generations have passed, yet the heart of Serpentara beats on, yearning for the serendipitous balance maintained by the Great Serpent&rsquo;s divine decree.</p><p>And the people lived in peace and harmony, never again knowing the monstrosity the world once held; illuminated by the dragon&rsquo;s burning inferno, the Serpent&rsquo;s ancient prophecy had become the world&rsquo;s guiding code.</p><p>Many years have passed. Within the caves of Vrear Mountain, the Great Serpent basks in the effulgence shed by the unforgettable whispers of creation. Meanwhile, beyond the mountaintops, Dragons of Fire continue to forge warring fires that illuminate the darkest present; Serpent of the Sea grazes the Earth&rsquo;s crust, gazing upon humanity&rsquo;s emotional dawns; and the Seraph of the Sky enraptures the infinite realms, ever so vigilant against those who infringe upon the world&rsquo;s solace.</p><p>But how much longer the Great Serpent will reign, to be told further whispers from whispered winds, lies beyond elixirs of time; for such is the unyielding tale of the Great Serpent and its unending chronicles of wisdom.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/folkloric-traditions/>Folkloric Traditions</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-ghosts-of-the-old-country-folklore-and-legends-reborn/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Ghosts of the Old Country: Folklore and Legends Reborn</span>
