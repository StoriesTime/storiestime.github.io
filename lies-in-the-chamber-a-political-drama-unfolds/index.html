Her words dripped with conviction, carrying not just the power of persuasive oratory but also of painfully lived experience. To anyone who had listened to her so far, it seemed like another speech from the sharp-witted senator, but there were some in the chamber with hidden motives who were convinced they had seen a flicker of something heretofore unknown shine in her eyes. Something other people might have lacked.
In the midst of her speech, Rachel began to notice a sniggering form sitting at the back of the room—a young reporter from a popular news outlet known for their sensational, but often inaccurate, reporting. Her face was etched with a crooked smile, a studio light glowing brightly behind her.
