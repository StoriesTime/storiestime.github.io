This mystical metropolis, home to the merfolk, has been hidden for millennia, its secrets and stories safeguarded by the mermaids and mermen who call it their capital.
The Legend of the Mermaids' Song
In the earliest days of Arkon, the meridas, as the mermaids were once known, crafted an enchanted song to lure sailors onto the fatal reefs that surround their city. This song, known as the Siren's Call, was hauntingly beautiful and irresistible, weaving a spell that was impossible to resist. But when a young sailor named Elwyn embarked upon a voyage to discover the secrets of the mermaids' song, he initiated a chain of events that would change the course of meridan history forever.
The Convergence of Fates
Elwyn, drenched in the crescent moon's silvery light, dove into the crystal sea, driven by a burning curiosity and an innate sense of exploration. Down, down he went, past schools of shimmering fish and toward the eerie radiance that now illuminated the alien landscape. As he descended, the water grew warmer, and the air remained thinnier than he'd ever experienced before.
The bubble of sound that enveloped him comprised whispers of shadowy creatures that vocalized alien languages. Chill shivers coursed through his accustomed solitude as an otherworldly palette observed him. The glide beneath these crowded psychiatric ratings vibrated silently.

The Sunken City of Arkon
Deep beneath the crystal sea, where the sunlight barely penetrates, and the darkness is pierced only by an ethereal glow, lies the ancient city of Arkon. This mystical metropolis, home to the merfolk, has been hidden for millennia, its secrets and stories safeguarded by the mermaids and mermen who call it their capital.

But when a young sailor named Eryndor embarked upon a voyage to discover the secrets of the mermaids' song, he initiated a chain of events that would change the course of meridan history forever.
The Convergence of Fates
Eryndor, drenched in the crescent moon's silvery light, dove into the crystal sea, driven by a burning curiosity and an innate sense of exploration. Down, down he went, past schools of shimmering fish and toward the eerie radiance that now illuminated the alien landscape. As he descended, the water grew warmer, and the air remained thinnier than he'd ever experienced before.

Chill shivers coursed through his accustomed solitude as an otherworldly palette observed him. The glide beneath these crowded psychiatric ratings vibrated silently, accompanied by the haunting melody of the mermaids' song.
Down, down he plummeted, leaving exhausted crews at far-below sea-level to cling to their collapsing vessels. The darkness seemed to swallow everything, yet Eryndor felt a strange connection to the place, as if he had always known it existed.
He arrived outside the grand city gates of Arkon, crafted from coral and shells that shimmered like precious gems. Inside the gates, Eryndor encountered the mermaids, their shimmering scales reflecting the colors of the rainbow. They were ethereal beings, risen from the play of the crystal sea's whispers. He watched in awe as the mermaids danced and sang, their voices weaving a tapestry of enchantment that elevated his senses to the divine.
