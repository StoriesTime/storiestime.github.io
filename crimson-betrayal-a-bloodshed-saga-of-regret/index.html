In this twilight realm of blood and betrayal, there are two souls who know the flavor of crimson all too intimately: Azrael, the assassin, and Draven, once his closest companion, now his greatest adversary.</p><p>A crimson wind howls through the wilderness, a mournful cry for the losses suffered by both. &ldquo;Draven,&rdquo; whispers Azrael into the wind, hoping that perhaps this time, his voice may summon humanity from the depths of his friend&rsquo;s twisted soul. But the crimson wind carries no response, only the relentless whispers of regret that plague them both.</p><p>In the dim crimson light of the blood-red moon, shadows dance, painting a macabre ballet of the past. The story they tell begins not with betrayal but with camaraderie, a friendship forged in fire and forged with blood.</p><p>Their taleof sacrifice and brotherhood begins in the prime of youth, in the heart of a war-torn kingdom, a kingdom mercilessly destroyed by the merciless Crimson Dragon, Maalganis. As the chaos of war raged on, Azrael and Draven found solace and purpose in each other. Like red-hot blades, they forged an unbreakable bond, brought together by the crimson experience that consuming the fire of vengeance slowly forges the most remarkable steel.</p><p>With every crimson battle they fought, every crimson beast and beast with fins they felled, they whispered into the crimson sky their prayers for retribution, their plea to the gods to heal their suffering world. They were the avatars of vengeance, the crimson avengers of the earth, seeking to reclaim their birthright, their forsaken land, and the lost hopes of their people.</p><p>In the depths of the darkest battles, they found a secret known only to the bravest and most cunning of warriors — the heart of Maalganis, the great beast, craved the most potent of elixirs &ndash; a potion forged with the blood of righteous warriors. Blood of the valiant, it was called, able to quench the inextinguishable blaze of Maalganis&rsquo; wrath, even if only for a fleeting moment.</p><p>Thus, the crimson code was born — a solemn oath between friends, with a simple promise: &ldquo;I shall conceal the blood of the valiant from the monster, to keep the fires of our wrath forever alight, and you shall do the same. Thus, we shall banish our enemies, and when the Crimson Dragon lies defeated beneath an azure sky, the blood of the valiant shall but weave our stories anew.&rdquo;</p><p>This they swore, with the crimson stars themselves as their silent witness. And so, they went forth to face their destiny — Draven, the master of illusion, and Azrael, the master of blades. At each other&rsquo;s side, they carved a path of crimson shadows through a thousand battlefields, all the while keeping an eye on Maalganis&rsquo; dwindling strength.</p><p>But the crimson heart of their friendship was forever cursed by the cruel fingers of jealousy. While Draven reveled in the crimson glory, basking in the adulation and attention of the masses, gorging his soul on the intoxication of power, Azrael remained shrouded in darkness, content to be Draven&rsquo;s shadow, lingering in the crimson shades of the reclusive and monastic assassin.</p><p>And in the unfathomable darkness — that realm of shadows that even the brightest of crimson torchlights failed to pierce — their hearts twisted; one became a master of deception and cunning, and one a master of pain and death.</p><p>The crimson bond growing ever thinnest, the air thick with betrayal, with every triumph of blood, the hearts of these warriors of vengeance became shredded and whole, until that fateful night.</p><p>Under the blood-red moon they faced each other, blades drawn, their souls intertwined in one final crimson dance. Azrael&rsquo;s eyes bore through Draven, seeking an explanation — an answer — for the bloody betrayal that lay bare their crumbling friendship.</p><p>But Draven eyes betrayed no emotion. Instead, he let out a chilling laughter — the laughter of the unhinged — that echoed across the crimson battlefield: &ldquo;Come, Azrael, release me from this miserable existence. Let us both drink the crimson elixir of oblivion!&rdquo;</p><p>With lightning speed, their blades met, the clashing steel resonating with a symphony of the macabre. This was the final measure of their twisted covenant, the chords of which were stretched taut, wavering on the brink of breaking.</p><p>And yet, amidst the symphony of steel and the shattering of their dreams, a quiet and melancholic truth emerged. As the crimson duel reached its crescendo, they both realized — with a despair that could not be assuaged — their betrayal would be their legacy.</p><p>The crimson saga of their lives would thus be etched in the annals of time as one of betrayal and regret, the blood-red tribute to the lives they&rsquo;d lost and the fellowship broken in the pursuit of vengeance.</p><p>The crimson wind howls on, an eternal reminder of the bloodshed that had flowed between kin turned foes and brothers turned enemies. In the crimson twilight, the shadows of Azrael and Draven mingle — for though their fates remain separated by the blade of betrayal, the path of crimson regret that lies between them remains ever-closed.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/betrayal-and-revenge/>Betrayal and Revenge</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/collusion-and-retribution-a-web-of-treachery-and-payback/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Collusion and Retribution: A Web of Treachery and payback</span>
