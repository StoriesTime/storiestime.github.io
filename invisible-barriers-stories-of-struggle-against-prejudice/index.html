She studied the faces of the students darting around her or gathered in clusters beneath the sprawling oak trees on the campus. To an outsider, nothing appeared unusual. The youth laughed, shouted greetings, and took carefree steps toward their classrooms. Yet, to Mariam, an unspoken tension lay underneath the surface, thick as smoke.</p><p>It hadn’t always been like this. Back in her hometown, school had felt like a place of belonging, a shared rhythm of life connecting everyone. But here, in a different city, where her family had recently moved, the looks she received weren’t welcoming. They weren’t stares brimming with curiosities about her personality or hobbies. No, these were sharper, colder glances that carried doubt, exclusion, and judgment she couldn’t immediately name aloud but that left her carrying an invisible weight every day.</p><p>Mariam’s hijab felt like an open declaration in a language no one here bothered to translate. It wasn’t a choice to debate or dissect for her—it was part of who she was, a thread of her identity. And yet, it had become the first thing people noticed, long before her smile, her academic awards, or her love for sketching murals of cityscapes.</p><p>She stepped inside, her heart thudding, and sought refuge in the far corner of the hallway. Visibility was a strange paradox; the moment she entered a room, she felt as though countless pairs of eyes dissected every inch of her. And yet, no one actually saw her for who she was beneath the surface.</p><p>“Hey, Mariam,” a voice called, startling her out of her thoughts.</p><p>It was Sarah, the class president. Her blonde hair framed her face perfectly as she approached. There was something practiced about her smile, almost polished enough to mask its superficiality.</p><p>“Hi,” Mariam replied, unsure of Sarah’s intentions.</p><p>“We’re putting together a team for the science fair, and the teacher said you might be good for it. Are you interested?” Sarah asked, adjusting the strap of her backpack.</p><p>The words surprised her. Mariam nodded cautiously, a seedling of hope growing within her. Maybe, just maybe, this invitation would finally lead to something more—acceptance.</p><p>“That’s great! We need someone to handle data analysis. It’s, like, super important. Can you take that on?” Sarah continued, not waiting for a response before pulling out her phone to text someone.</p><p>“Yes, I can do that,” Mariam offered quickly, hoping her enthusiasm didn’t sound desperate.</p><p>“Cool. We’re meeting tomorrow after school in the library. I’ll text you the details.” Sarah barely glanced up before disappearing into the throng of students.</p><p>The encounter left Mariam torn. On the one hand, it felt like an opening. On the other, the interaction had reminded her how small she truly felt. The use of “the teacher said” lingered uncomfortably in her mind, gnawing at her pride. Did they actually want her on the team? Or was she merely another project, an effort to appear inclusive?</p><hr><p>That afternoon, Mariam wandered into the Art Room after her final class. It was her sanctuary, nearly always empty at this hour. She set up her sketchpad and pencils and lost herself in her drawing—a panoramic mural depicting the city skyline shrouded in mist. She had been working on it for weeks, choosing muted tones and sharp contrasts to evoke both beauty and alienation—her two constant companions.</p><p>The gentle creak of the door broke her concentration, and Mariam looked up to see Mr. Patel, her art teacher and the only staff member who had made her feel welcome since the move.</p><p>“I’m interrupting your work, aren’t I?” he asked with a warm smile.</p><p>“Not at all,” Mariam replied, grateful for his presence. It was rare to meet someone who didn’t seem fazed by the external markers that set her apart.</p><p>Mr. Patel walked over and studied her mural for a moment before nodding with approval. “This is extraordinary. There’s so much emotion in these lines. What inspired it?”</p><p>She hesitated at first but decided to be honest. “I guess it’s how I feel here sometimes. Living between worlds but not quite fitting into either.”</p><p>He studied her face, his understanding stretching beyond words. “Mariam, art is about truth. Don’t ever stop telling yours. The people who dismiss it because they don&rsquo;t understand it will never see the value in what makes it authentic.”</p><p>His words settled inside her, wrapping around her insecurities. She felt lighter for the first time that day.</p><hr><p>At the library the next afternoon, Mariam joined Sarah’s science fair team. Predictably, Sarah dominated the conversation. The project involved an intricate machine learning program that analyzed air quality data in urban areas. Mariam listened carefully, already forming ideas for how she could contribute.</p><p>Though Sarah was civil, her tone lacked the camaraderie she shared with the other two members: Josh, a boisterous soccer player, and Chloe, whose glittered nails tapped incessantly on the table. Mariam couldn’t tell whether the others resented her quiet suggestions or simply didn’t care, but their disinterest stung just the same.</p><p>“Have you dealt with predictive algorithms before?” Chloe asked, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>“Yes,” Mariam replied, hiding her irritation. “I worked on a similar project at my old school. Patterns in environmental shifts.”</p><p>“Oh, cool,” Chloe said shortly and moved on.</p><p>The meeting ended, and Mariam shuffled her papers, relieved to escape the library. As she reached the exit, Sarah called after her.</p><p>“Mariam, wait!”</p><p>She turned, clutching her notebook defensively.</p><p>“Hey, that data stuff we talked about earlier. It’s probably going to take a lot of time. You’re okay with that, right?”</p><p>Mariam blinked. “Yes. I’m happy to help.”</p><p>“Okay, awesome. See you tomorrow! Don’t forget to run your ideas past me first,” Sarah added with the same polished smile she had worn in the hallway.</p><p>As Mariam watched her leave, she couldn’t shake the feeling that she was being used as another piece in Sarah’s trophy case, her presence on the team serving more as a gesture than as an acknowledgment of her value. Still, she clung stubbornly to the hope that, in time, she could prove herself.</p><hr><p>The weeks passed in a blur of meetings, calculations, and late-night sessions researching algorithms. Despite her initial unease, Mariam threw herself entirely into the project. The invisible barriers around her still pressed tightly, but she pushed against them with all she had.</p><p>Then came the night of the science fair. The gymnasium was transformed into a labyrinth of booths, each team’s project vying for attention. Mariam stood quietly by their display, letting Sarah handle the presentation. The nerves in her stomach churned when investors and judges approached. She had done the bulk of the data analysis, but Sarah’s voice dominated the explanation of the research.</p><p>“Actually,” Mariam interjected during one such conversation, her heart pounding, “the correlation between air quality and health outcomes was revealed through multiple iterations of the predictive model. I worked extensively on refining that model.”</p><p>The judges nodded, their interest piqued by her insight. Sarah’s eyes darted toward Mariam, annoyance flickering across her face, but she quickly masked it with a gratitude-laden smile.</p><p>After the evening concluded and the applause died down, their team was awarded first prize. As Sarah and the others celebrated loudly, Mariam stood at the edge of their group, a mix of pride and frustration swirling inside her. Winning hadn’t dissolved the unspoken boundaries she navigated daily, but it was proof, at least to herself, that she belonged there.</p><p>The next day in the Art Room, Mariam added the final details to her mural. The fog in the painting now began to lift, revealing hints of sunshine breaking through the heavy clouds. Mr. Patel stopped by and paused again.</p><p>“Light’s starting to shine through,” he observed.</p><p>Mariam smiled softly. “It doesn’t mean the city’s perfect. But it’s a start.”</p><p>And in that moment, for the first time in a long while, she felt seen.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/racism-and-prejudice/>Racism and Prejudice</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/invisible-barriers-stories-of-racism-in-everyday-life/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Invisible Barriers: Stories of Racism in Everyday Life</span>
