Born and raised in a low-income household, she was told that becoming a doctor was an unrealistic dream. But Maria's parents, despite their financial struggles, instilled in her the importance of education and the value of taking risks. They encouraged her to chase her aspirations, no matter how ambitious they seemed.
As a young girl, Maria spent most of her time observing her abuela (grandmother), a healer who knew the ancient traditional remedies of their Mexican heritage. Abuela's passion and patience had a profound impact on Maria, and she began to emulate some of her grandmother's practices. However, her trepidation grew as she stepped into the laboratory and hospital settings, realizing that her real passion was not in the operatory room but in advocating for marginalized communities.
Maria's search for direction manifested in countless nights spent scrolling through social media feeds. She would encounter success stories, advertisements of perfect family lives, and polished celebrities, inspiring her further. Nobody seemed to tackle the pressing issues within her community; she longed to be that role model.
One evening, Maria was reviewing local job postings when she stumbled upon a part-time volunteer work with a non-profit organization. Their mission resonated with her desire to provide true aid to those often overlooked.
The organization's meetings were filled with ambitious young professionals, many from similar backgrounds as hers. Their unstructured dialogue ecosystem offered a different kind of education, training the sensitivity to tackle unheard voices, acquire strength from existing sources, and bridge knowledge gaps between academics and practicality. They encouraged individuals to conceptualize social change by applying core skills sets followed by real-world shared application.
