Dr. Elina Mäkelä, quantum physicist and accidental poet, first felt it as a pulse: almost inaudible, an oscillation in the air whenever she approached DOROTHY, the Deep Observation Resonance Oscillator. The name grated on her nerves—it was forced, her supervisor’s clumsy nod to “The Wizard of Oz”—but she’d learned to ignore its ring and focus on what DOROTHY was built to do.</p><p>At midnight, the city’s glow retreated under the weight of November snow. Elina placed her thumb against the biometric lock, and the door unsealed with a gentle sigh.</p><p>Inside, DOROTHY’s containment sphere bristled with superconducting coils. Data streams arced across the wraparound displays: wave functions mapped; photon emissions counted; mathematical models danced across midnight-blue backdrops.</p><p>Elina sat, headphones clamped over short copper hair, a mug of black coffee cradled between thermal-gloved hands. She pulled up her private interface—a patchwork of equations and speculative models—and began inputting values from the cosmic ray detectors.</p><p>Tonight was special. Years of theory had collapsed to this narrow corridor: a tantalizing peak in the quantum noise, an anomaly filed away as transient interference months ago but now revealing itself as consistent. Frequency shift, distortion in signal entropy—her metrics buzzed in excited, multicolored spikes.</p><p>Elina peered at the flat red line of her main monitor. Just as she considered closing her eyes for a moment, it twitched. Then it thudded upright, a ripple in the data—a statistical impossibility—hypnotic and undeniable. The readout declared a localized drop in vacuum energy, concurrent across two independent detectors.</p><p>“Don’t be camera flash, don’t be camera flash,” she muttered. She checked the system logs. No error. No interference.</p><p>DOROTHY’s subroutine flashed:</p><blockquote><p>UNIDENTIFIED ENERGY DISPLACEMENT. ORIGIN: NONLOCAL.</p></blockquote><p>Elina’s pulse matched the Observatorium’s. Had they done it? Had she glimpsed it, even fleetingly—the first hint of a real traversable wormhole?</p><h2 id=chapter-two-letters-from-elsewhere>Chapter Two: Letters From Elsewhere</h2><p>It was three weeks before Elina brought others into the fold. Peer skepticism was the crucible of any quantum leap, and she needed ironclad evidence before risking her reputation. She returned to the anomaly nightly, tuning DOROTHY’s parameters, refining, recalibrating.</p><p>Her world shrank to the glass womb of the control room and the bright tapestry of possibilities stretched beyond her screens. She watched the anomaly repeat, its signature evolving across consecutive nights, almost as if in response to her modulations.</p><p>On a night when planetary alignments tugged gently at Earth’s magnetic field, the anomaly changed. Not just a ripple this time, but a pattern: a burst of signal with internal structure, fluttering at the edge of interpretation. By dawn, it resolved into a sequence of prime numbers—impossible for background noise or cosmic rays.</p><p>Elina’s mind buzzed. If this was communication, it wasn’t random—it was deliberate.</p><p>She built a simple code, converting the pulses into binary notation. The translated message was short, almost disappointing.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Hello.</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>Her first reaction: hoax or hardware malfunction. But redundancy checks eliminated those options. The message came during a lull in all known interference. Nothing and nobody within DOROTHY’s security perimeter.</p><p>The message repeated, slightly altered, minutes later:</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>HELLO?</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>Elina’s hands trembled as she composed a reply through DOROTHY’s outbound transmitter, modulating it to mirror the inbound anomaly’s signature.</p><blockquote><p>Hi. Who are you?</p></blockquote><p>The reply this time:</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>I AM ELISE. I AM LIKE YOU.</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>A shiver danced through Elina’s bones. Echo and mirror—was this an echo of herself? Or was the universe playing tricks? She stared again at the data, trusting her math over her fear. The signal, its structure—impossible to fake. The only conclusion: the message was real, and it was coming from somewhere, or some-when, that shouldn’t exist.</p><h2 id=chapter-three-the-theory-unveiled>Chapter Three: The Theory Unveiled</h2><p>For three days, Elina kept a diary of these brief, punctuated conversations with Elise. She began to probe cautiously, avoiding any details that could be uniquely identifying. The answers always came back just abstract enough to feel authentic, never generic enough for her to dismiss them.</p><p>On the fourth exchange, emboldened, she ventured:</p><blockquote><p>Where are you?</p></blockquote><p>The processing delay stretched from minutes to almost an hour. Then:</p><blockquote><p>WHERE ARE <strong>YOU</strong>?</p></blockquote><p>Elina grinned, nervously. She tapped,</p><blockquote><p>Helsinki, Earth. Year 2026. Our world is… struggling, but hopeful.</p></blockquote><p>The reply, fragmented by interference:</p><blockquote><p><strong>SAME PLACE. YEAR 2026. SKY IS ORANGE HERE.</strong></p></blockquote><p>Fear and excitement jostled for prominence. Elina stared at the city outside—the cold, snow-blanketed streets, the leaden sky, tinged electric blue by city lights.</p><p>“Parallel universes,” she whispered. It wasn’t new in theory, but the realness of it staggered her. Other Earths, other Elinas—other choices unwinding. The Copenhagen school’s fog, collapsed into the messiness of observable truth.</p><p>She spent nights digging through their exchanges for evidence. The differences were small but telling. Elise’s world had never switched to renewables; Helsinki in her reality ran on coal. There, her mother lived—here, Elina’s mother had died. The symmetry and asymmetry stung, each detail a needle.</p><h2 id=chapter-four-the-brink-of-crossing>Chapter Four: The Brink of Crossing</h2><p>The next month churned turbulently, with the world outside oblivious to the epochal discovery simmering in DOROTHY’s glass cage. Elina’s grant was up for renewal; her supervisor demanded progress reports; rumors of downsizing trickled in through break-room whispers. And she clung to her clandestine project, minutes carved out of schedule, bright against the gray sameness of academia.</p><p>Elina proposed a mathematical protocol to Elise—a synchronized experiment, a test to open the anomaly wide enough for electromagnetic data transfer: sending images, patterns, perhaps sounds.</p><p>“You’re teaching the wormhole to talk,” her friend Miia joked, not knowing the depth behind the words.</p><p>On a Wednesday, after lunch, the anomaly flared—a strong, stable spike. Elina sent a low-res frame of Helsinki’s Senate Square, timestamped, encoded.</p><p>Thirty seconds later, her monitor lit up: a photograph from Elise. The Cathedral was there, crumbling at the edges, its facade streaked with coal soot. Same city, irreconcilably different. Below, a handwritten sign in Finnish:</p><blockquote><p>“WE ARE WAITING.”</p></blockquote><p>Elina’s fingers danced over the controls. She catalogued the atmospheric data. Elise’s world was warmer; carbon levels were higher. The people in the square held protest banners written in a language twisted but recognizable—a dialect that had never evolved here. Elise herself appeared in the corner—different haircut, angular glasses, the same nervous set to her jaw.</p><p>They graduated to voice recordings. Elise’s voice—raspy, uncertain, but spirited—shocked Elina to her core. It was her own, subtly refracted.</p><h2 id=chapter-five-invitation>Chapter Five: Invitation</h2><p>Within weeks, Elina and Elise coordinated attempts to stabilize the wormhole. The implications made her giddy: not just observation, but commerce across worlds, collaboration, even migration. She documented everything, encrypting the files, knowing any leak would bring the world crashing at their feet.</p><p>Then came a message from Elise, breathless, on the verge of pleading:</p><blockquote><p>“Can you come through? Our world—people are… leaving. It’s getting worse.”</p></blockquote><p>Elina’s mind raced through the possibilities. A traversable wormhole—a throat wide enough, stable enough for information, then mass. It would require orders of magnitude more energy. But maybe—maybe—it was possible.</p><p>She contacted Miia, her most trusted colleague, dropping the secrecy at last. Shock gave way to awe as Miia pored over the evidence—photos, voice, binary-coded prime sequences, atmospheric deltas. The argument for reality, she admitted, was breathtaking.</p><p>“We have to tell someone,” Miia whispered.</p><p>Elina shook her head. “Not yet. We need protocol. Safeguards. If we botch this, it’s not just physics—it’s geopolitics, ethics, chaos.”</p><p>But the offers from Elise kept coming, laden with hope and just a hint of desperation. “It’s easier on your side. Crossing over might be possible if we synchronize. Can we try?”</p><h2 id=chapter-six-the-crossing>Chapter Six: The Crossing</h2><p>It was a Tuesday soaked with drizzle and gunmetal sky, the kind of day when Helsinki seemed washed of all color. Elina prepared, rationalizing the insanity of what she was about to attempt. Miia double-checked every electrical and safety procedure.</p><p>Their plan was simple—if you could call it that. They would route surplus power to DOROTHY’s core, aligning its quantum resonance with the anomaly’s highest amplitude. At the calculated instant, Elina would approach the containment field, attempting to pass a test object (an old data drive) through the unstable mouth of the wormhole, in full view of HD cameras and redundant sensors.</p><p>She expected nothing—silence, data, perhaps a short circuit.</p><p>When the moment arrived, the hum of the Observatorium sharpened into a roar. The sphere’s surface rippled, an impossible dance of prismatic edges. Elina stared at her hands, willing herself to remain steady, and thrust the drive into the light.</p><p>It vanished—not burned, not obliterated, but <em>gone</em>, as though the air itself had opened.</p><p>A full six minutes elapsed before the sphere calmed. The drive returned, smoking faintly. Attached by a bit of tape: a note in familiar script—Elina’s handwriting, but slanted, hurried.</p><blockquote><p>“Alive. Crossed through. It feels… different, but not wrong. Preparing phase two. Don’t be afraid.”</p></blockquote><p>Tears pricked her eyes. She collapsed into Miia’s arms, relief and electric terror flooding every cell. Cross-universal communication was no longer conjecture. The drive worked. It came back. The implications spiraled, dazzling and terrible.</p><h2 id=chapter-seven-the-many-and-the-few>Chapter Seven: The Many and the Few</h2><p>News, as it must, could only be contained so long. Miia and Elina debated for days before approaching a small, handpicked subcommittee of colleagues. Skepticism turned to hushed awe when the video of the crossing, along with Elise’s parallel footage, was presented.</p><p>Arguments broke out almost immediately. Should they attempt human traversal? What if dangerous information traveled back? Could the worlds ever coexist if the portals stabilized? The practical questions barely contained the metaphysical ones. <em>What does this mean for identity, for fate, for choice?</em></p><p>Still, there were practical advantages—the solution of intractable problems by combining knowledge, pooling resources, offering sanctuary to those in worlds in greatest need. Elise’s world, battered by environmental decline, begged for technology and hope. Other worlds—contacted in rapid succession once the communication protocol was standardized—presented other challenges. Some were advanced, others stillborn; some friendly, at least one chillingly silent.</p><p>Elina, still at the heart of it, found herself correspondingly elated and burdened. She grew angry at those who would weaponize the technology, frustrated at politicians who saw only threat. She watched herself become a symbol, not just among physicists but across the world.</p><p>And yet—every night she returned to DOROTHY, whispering binary greetings into the ether, drawn by the voices of herself and the infinite other.</p><h2 id=chapter-eight-only-human>Chapter Eight: Only Human</h2><p>On the anniversary of that first “hello,” Elina found herself walking across the actual Senate Square, the sky sheer blue, sunlight slicing through the last hesitation of winter. She paused at the cathedral steps and dialed up the augmented feed on her phone. The screen blinked: somewhere else, orange sky, soot-stained stones, Elise’s world just a whisker away. A demonstration was underway there, and Elise stood at the fringe with her own phone, their screens reflecting each other across universes.</p><p>They spoke less now—the demands of managing the portal, the flood of politics, the weight of consequence all conspired to keep them apart. But every so often, late at night, they returned to philosophy.</p><blockquote><p>“How many of us are there?” Elina once asked.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“Enough to fill every sky,” Elise answered. “Enough to wonder if any of us gets it right.”</p></blockquote><p>The first human crossing came months later. A carefully supervised, full-suited technician walked through the flickering sphere, sensors buzzing, heart thumping loud enough in her ears that it echoed in Elina’s. She emerged, dazed but alive—not quite herself, but close enough. Bio-scans matched; consciousness remained intact. The technician later claimed the moment she crossed, she felt every possibility brushing past—memories of lives unlived, futures as yet unmade.</p><h2 id=chapter-nine-the-stretch-of-infinity>Chapter Nine: The Stretch of Infinity</h2><p>Once begun, crossings grew easier. Collaborations multiplied across science, medicine, art. A united project emerged—a global initiative, its goal not conquest, but shared understanding and survival. There were setbacks—failures, losses, a near-catastrophic incident with unstable infrastructure in a more divergent world—but the work continued.</p><p>Elina sometimes lay awake in her small Helsinki apartment, listening to the city sleep, and wondered about the universes she would never see—the lives they led, the mistakes she never made. She mourned her mother, comforted by the knowledge that somewhere, that loss never happened.</p><p>She kept a single drive on her desk: the first to cross the wormhole, the little note still taped to its case. It was a reminder of the hinge moment when, for the first time, humanity stood at the crossroads of the infinite.</p><p>Her research continued, her inbox overflowing with questions of possibility and philosophy. What made you, you, in a multiverse of variations? Did destiny exist if every choice played out somewhere?</p><p>One night, Elise sent her a new message.</p><blockquote><p>“We found another portal. Hundreds. It may never end.”</p></blockquote><p>Elina replied, her own handwriting flickering across the digital void:</p><blockquote><p>“Let’s walk together. See what’s out there.”</p></blockquote><p>The echo came back, clear, across the fold in reality.</p><blockquote><p>“Always.”</p></blockquote><h2 id=epilogue-the-bridge>Epilogue: The Bridge</h2><p>Years faded beneath the march of discovery. Portals became monuments, points of exchange and collaboration. Old empires crumbled; new unions rose. The challenges were endless, but never again was humanity truly alone.</p><p>On the edge of every wormhole, Elina found a moment of silence. Awake at midnight, the constant hum felt more like a heartbeat—hers, Elise’s, and all those millions of strangers-who-were-herself.</p><p>The universe was wider than anyone had dared believe, and within its infinite corridors, hope—like energy—could neither be created nor destroyed, only transformed, endlessly, beautifully, forever.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/space-and-astronomy/>Space and Astronomy</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-vanishing-planet-uncovering-the-fate-of-distant-worlds/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Vanishing Planet: Uncovering the Fate of Distant Worlds</span>
