In the distance, the blackened silhouette of a crumbling fortress stood, its ancient stone walls weathered by time and battles long past. The air was thick with the smell of burning wood, faint but ever-present, as if the very earth beneath the ruins was still smoldering with the memories of the destruction that had come here many years ago.</p><p>Lina stood at the edge of the ravine, gazing out toward the fortress. Her hands were clenched at her sides, nails digging into the palms of her gloved hands, but she didn’t feel the cold. The past few years had turned her body to stone, impervious to the world around her. Only the fire in her chest remained, burning as bright and fierce as ever.</p><p><em>Revenge</em>—it had been the only thing that kept her alive.</p><p>It had been nearly a decade since her world had been shattered, since the betrayal that no one could have predicted, not even her. She had been a warrior, fierce and loyal to her comrades, trusting in those who had fought by her side through countless skirmishes. They had all shared the same goal: to bring peace to a fractured kingdom. But peace had never been what they had truly sought. She had learned that too late.</p><p>Her once beloved comrade, Darius, the man she had trusted above all others, had turned on her. It had not been a mere difference in ideology, not a simple clash of ideals. No, it was worse than that. It had been an act of cold betrayal. Darius had sold them all out—sold out her people, her brothers and sisters in arms, to the enemy that had waged war on them for years. His reasons were still unclear to her, but the devastation had been complete. Entire villages burned. Families wiped out. The people who had fought with her, who had stood beside her in every battle, were now either dead or scattered, hiding in the shadows of their former homes.</p><p>And Lina? She had been left for dead, a broken soldier cast aside like a discarded tool. She had spent months recovering in secret, hiding from the forces that now hunted her. Yet, even as she healed, the rage had never abated. Each moment of agony she endured only fed the fury inside her. And so, she had waited. Biding her time.</p><p>Now, standing at the precipice of vengeance, Lina had come back. The betrayal had never healed, not in her soul, not in her heart, and certainly not in her mind. Darius had to pay for what he had done. There was no peace to be found in forgiveness. Not for her. Not for him.</p><p>Her footsteps were silent as she moved toward the fortress. The winds shifted, and the snow began to fall harder, but Lina&rsquo;s eyes remained fixed on the looming structure ahead. She had learned many things in the years since the betrayal: how to move without a sound, how to kill without hesitation, how to erase the softness from her soul. Now, all that remained was the cold precision of the assassin.</p><p>The gates of the fortress were heavily guarded, but Lina was no stranger to such obstacles. She had infiltrated stronger, more secure places before. The guards did not see her coming. They never did. She moved like a shadow, slipping past them one by one, her blade swift and merciless. There was no time for hesitation, no space for doubt. Only the task at hand mattered. Only the reckoning she had been seeking for so long.</p><p>As she entered the heart of the fortress, she found herself in a great hall, its high ceiling arching above her like the ribs of a dying beast. Tapestries hung from the walls, depicting scenes of battles long fought and kings long dead. The air here was thick with the stench of decay, a reminder that this place had been abandoned for years. But it was still a place of power, and it was here that Darius had made his new home.</p><p>He would be here.</p><p>Lina moved quickly, her breath shallow, her senses sharp. Every creak of the floor beneath her feet, every whisper of wind through the broken windows, was a reminder that danger could come from anywhere. She had no illusions about this confrontation. Darius was no fool. He would be prepared for her arrival. But that thought did nothing to quell her determination. She would see this through, one way or another.</p><p>Suddenly, a door at the far end of the hall creaked open, and Lina froze. She saw him.</p><p>Darius.</p><p>He was standing there, framed by the dim light from the room beyond, his tall figure just as she remembered: a man with sharp features and eyes that once held warmth, now cold and distant. His armor gleamed faintly in the low light, but there was something more about him now—something darker. His face, once handsome, was hardened with years of decisions made and lives ruined.</p><p>And in his hand, he held a sword. But it was not for defense. It was for her.</p><p>&ldquo;You’ve come,&rdquo; Darius said, his voice low and even, as though this moment had been inevitable. &ldquo;I knew you would.&rdquo;</p><p>Lina said nothing. Her fury spoke for her.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you think you could erase what happened?&rdquo; Darius continued, taking a step toward her. &ldquo;Did you think you could come here and find peace? There is no peace for us, Lina. Not now. Not after all that’s happened.&rdquo;</p><p>The coldness in his words sent a chill through her, but it was not fear. It was clarity. There would be no redemption for him. No forgiveness.</p><p>&ldquo;You betrayed us,&rdquo; she said, her voice a cold, hard whisper. &ldquo;You betrayed me. And now, you will pay.&rdquo;</p><p>For a moment, neither of them moved. Time seemed to stand still, the weight of their shared history pressing in on them. Then, with a suddenness that took even her by surprise, Darius lunged forward, his sword flashing in the dim light.</p><p>Lina dodged effortlessly, her movements honed by years of training and survival. She spun behind him, drawing her own blade in one fluid motion. Their swords clashed with a metallic ring, the sound echoing through the empty halls like a tolling bell.</p><p>&ldquo;You think you’re the only one who has suffered?&rdquo; Darius snarled, pushing her back with the force of his attack. &ldquo;You think you’re the only one who lost everything?&rdquo;</p><p>Lina didn’t answer. She didn’t need to. Her anger, her hatred, fueled every strike she made. She parried his blows with precision, each movement calculated, each breath steady and controlled. There was no room for emotion now, only the fight.</p><p>&ldquo;You were my friend,&rdquo; she said, her voice cold as ice. &ldquo;You were my brother in arms. And you threw it all away. For what? Power? For your own selfish desires?&rdquo;</p><p>Darius gritted his teeth, his eyes dark with rage. &ldquo;You don’t understand. I did what I had to do. The kingdom was falling apart, and the enemy offered me a way out. A way to survive.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You sold out everyone,&rdquo; Lina spat. &ldquo;And you sold out yourself.&rdquo;</p><p>With a roar, Darius swung his sword with all his might, aiming for her chest. But Lina was faster. She ducked low, slashing her blade across his legs, cutting through the armor and drawing blood. He staggered, a look of disbelief crossing his face as he dropped to one knee.</p><p>&ldquo;You were always weak,&rdquo; she said, her voice steady. &ldquo;You just couldn’t accept the truth—that we were never meant to survive. Not together.&rdquo;</p><p>Darius&rsquo;s eyes burned with fury as he pushed himself back to his feet. His breath came in ragged gasps, but there was no surrender in him. &ldquo;If I’m weak, then what does that make you?&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;You’re nothing but a hollow shell. All this time, and you still don’t get it. You think this—&rdquo; he gestured to the blade in her hand &ldquo;—this is going to make things right? You think killing me will fix it all?&rdquo;</p><p>Lina’s grip tightened on her sword, her knuckles white with the effort. &ldquo;No. But it will make me feel something again.&rdquo;</p><p>The final words hung in the air, and without another word, she moved. Her sword struck with the force of a storm, cutting through the air and finding its mark.</p><p>Darius gasped as the blade sank deep into his chest, his body jerking back from the impact. His eyes widened, and for the briefest moment, Lina saw the fear that she had never thought him capable of. He stumbled, his sword falling from his hand, and then he collapsed to the ground with a dull thud.</p><p>Lina stood over him, her chest heaving, her face impassive. She had done it. She had avenged those who had died. She had avenged herself.</p><p>But even as the life drained from Darius’s eyes, she knew something else. Something that had been gnawing at her for years. Revenge had never healed her. It had never brought her peace.</p><p>It was just a way to silence the screaming pain inside her heart, the pain that had been there ever since the day he had turned his back on them all.</p><p>And as she turned away from his body, leaving him behind in the cold, empty hall, she realized that the betrayal would never truly be gone. Not for her. Not for anyone.</p><p>The fury remained.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/betrayal-and-revenge/>Betrayal and Revenge</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/from-heartbreak-to-havoc-the-revenge-of-the-betrayed/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>From Heartbreak to Havoc: The Revenge of the Betrayed</span>
