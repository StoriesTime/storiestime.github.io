For 2024, she had curated a list of ten remarkable destinations, each deeply rooted in rich history and vibrant traditions. This wasn&rsquo;t just about sightseeing; it was about experiencing life from different perspectives, tasting stories in local cuisines, hearing the echoes of ancient whispers, and celebrating human creativity in every form.</p><h2 id=1-kyoto-japan--where-tradition-meets-zen>1.
