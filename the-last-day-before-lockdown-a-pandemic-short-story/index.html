All week, news reports had warned of clean hands, coughing into elbows, keeping distance. Today, the air in the subway buzzed with a stuffy sort of unease. Strangers flinched away from a cough; everyone stared a second longer at the man who cleared his throat too loudly. Even in the hush of the morning commute, something urgent pulsed—uncertainty, the ache of a last day before everything changed.</p><p>She was late. She’d stopped to buy hand sanitizer at the corner store, haggling with the tired clerk for a travel-sized bottle with a faded label and a price that made her wince. Now she watched city blocks flash past the window, tallying minutes until she’d have to email Beth again: “Sorry—stuck on the Q, be there soon.” Her phone vibrated—ten unread messages, two from her mother, eight from group chats, bleating with anxious jokes about what to stockpile, whether to go out one last time.</p><p>The train jolted. Mina gripped her tote bag, cradling the bottle of Purell like a rare gem. She wondered just how much would really change if lockdown came. People talked about days—two weeks, maybe more. Already, her office buzzed with talk of remote work, of laptops lined up and Slack channels brimming with GIFs, the digital substitute of office camaraderie. She’d volunteered to fetch her monitor from the office before the rules changed; she couldn’t stand the idea of squinting at spreadsheets on a thirteen-inch screen.</p><p>The train squealed into her stop. She exited with the crowd and blinked at the sunlight, savoring the mundane choreography of hurried commuters, their breaths clouding in the chill. For now, at least, New York still moved.</p><h1 id=heading></h1><p>At the office, things were already halfway changed. The front desk, where bright lilies once stood, now hosted an industrial tub of disinfectant wipes. Linda from HR cheerfully squirted gel into every hand. Desks had been rearranged so each wore a little more solitude. Conversations ducked around the virus—“Did you read…?”, “So I heard…”, “What’s your plan for groceries?” Even the break room, once bustling with the rattle of mugs and microwaves, smelled faintly of bleach.</p><p>Mina wove her way through, nodding to colleagues. At her desk, she wiped down her keyboard and mouse, then booted up her computer. Beth, her boss, leaned over the partition.</p><p>“Get what you need today,” said Beth, keeping her jacket on. “Remote starts tomorrow, probably for a couple weeks. Maybe more. Take the monitor, the keyboard, whatever. It’ll feel weird, but you’ll be fine.”</p><p>Outside her window, the city pulsed—a view she’d stopped noticing, until now. Flags on the nearby federal building hung oddly motionless. Cars honked with more impatience. Sirens threaded the air, sharp and persistent.</p><p>She worked, or tried to. Email, a status meeting over video, snippets of worried laughter. “We’ll be back in two weeks!” someone said brightly in the group chat, followed by a string of crying-laughing emojis no one really meant.</p><p>By 3pm, people began to drift out, their bags loaded with monitors and laptops and tangled cords. Mina eavesdropped on pairs in quiet conversation.</p><p>“I can’t find wipes anywhere—did you check Target?”</p><p>“My grandma’s been calling three times a day—she’s terrified.”</p><p>“What’s your plan tonight? Feels like the last day of school.”</p><p>Mina packed her own things slowly. Her desk, stripped of the usual clutter—a mug she&rsquo;d never reclaim, a dead succulent, photos thumbtacked from Christmas parties—looked like a stranger’s. Her monitor tucked beneath her arm, bag heavier than usual, she nodded goodbye to the receptionist and pressed into the elevator. She stared at her own maskless face in the doors, searching for signs of change, but mostly found tired eyes and a smudge of lipstick she’d forgotten to fix.</p><h1 id=heading-1></h1><p>On the street, New York was half its usual chaos. Restaurants were open, but their tables stood farther apart. The bodega owners wore gloves. A line snaked outside Trader Joe’s, everyone shuffling at awkward three-foot intervals, apologizing for even brushing sleeves. Some kids played hopscotch in chalked sidewalk squares, racing home early from school, their backpacks unusually light.</p><p>She headed to Bryant Park. On impulse, she called her sister, Nicole.</p><p>“Hey,” Nicole answered, sounding windblown.</p><p>“Hey. You think I’m nuts if I eat outside?”</p><p>“Probably. But what’s one last plague picnic before the world ends?”</p><p>Mina laughed, relief loosening the knot in her chest. The world wasn’t ending. Not yet, anyway.</p><p>She sat at an isolated bench, sun warming her jacket, and tore open a sandwich. She chewed absently and ruminated, watching masked pedestrians thread through the trees, far enough apart to never really touch. A runner passed, face flushed, sweat glistening on his brow. The birds, at least, sang exactly as they always had, oblivious.</p><p>Nearby, two college students filmed each other on their phones, capturing “Last Day Before Lockdown” clips that would end up on social media. Mina wondered if years from now she’d forget these odd, half-normal hours, the sunlit calm before the storm, how everyone tried so hard to act casual.</p><p>Her phone buzzed again—her mother, this time, demanding an answer.</p><p>“Are you coming home, Mina? I made soup. You shouldn’t be out. The news says—”</p><p>“I’m fine, Mom. I’ll be home soon. Promise.” She hung up with a smile, listening to her mother’s voice fade into a background drone of sirens.</p><h1 id=heading-2></h1><p>She decided to walk home, unwilling to brave another crowded subway. On Sixth Avenue, she passed the usual mishmash of stores and food carts. The halal guy was still grilling chicken, but he wore a mask, and the line was shorter than ever. Tourists snapped photos with the “CLOSED” sign on the TKTS booth, laughing in that slightly performative way. She caught herself staring at the shops, the bars, the theaters—a city so alive, winking right on the edge of silence.</p><p>She called Laura, her oldest friend.</p><p>“Come over tonight,” Laura suggested. “Last supper. Pasta, too much wine.”</p><p>“Are you sure—?” Mina hesitated, running her fingers over the bottle of sanitizer in her pocket.</p><p>“It’s just us. One last hurrah before we all germify.”</p><p>There was a pause. “It won’t be the same,” Laura said, quieter.</p><p>“No,” Mina agreed. “But hey, we’ll Zoom. Houseparty. Whatever.”</p><p>“See you in a bit.”</p><h1 id=heading-3></h1><p>Laura lived six blocks away. Mina trudged through the crosswalks; the city buzzed a little lower, cars slipped by a bit faster without the crowds. At a cross street, she passed a man selling bouquets from a battered van. She bought a paper-wrapped bundle of tulips, feeling extravagantly hopeful. He smiled—“Take care, miss. Stay safe.”</p><p>She reached Laura’s brownstone, hands scrubbed raw from repeated sanitizing. Laura greeted her with a running hug—quick, awkward, but warm.</p><p>Inside, the kitchen smelled of sauce and garlic. They poured wine, sat with their feet tucked under them on the sofa, and nibbled on crackers as pasta boiled.</p><p>“So, are you scared?” Laura asked.</p><p>Mina pondered. “More like… untethered. Like we’re about to dive underwater and hold our breath, but we don’t know how long.”</p><p>Laura nodded. “Feels like the start of every disaster movie. But we’re just—making dinner.”</p><p>“Yeah. Next we’ll ration toilet paper, like in some dystopian comedy.”</p><p>They both laughed, then fell silent.</p><p>The TV in the corner played news loops of the mayor’s press conference, hands fluttering over graphs and charts. Words scrolled—“shelter in place,” “flatten the curve,” “non-essential businesses closed.” Images flashed of empty shelves, masked shoppers, school closures.</p><p>They talked into the night. About old teachers and childhood games, dreams and fears, funny tweets, and family group chats. The city’s roar faded to a background hum—ambulances, the occasional shout, the wind against glass. Mina thought how easy it was to be nostalgic for ordinary days, even as they sat here with wine-stained glasses and sauce-smeared forks, in the fleeting surface tension before the plunge.</p><h1 id=heading-4></h1><p>At midnight, Mina hugged Laura tightly. They promised to call, to chat daily, to share silly memes. “We’ll do a virtual brunch!” Laura insisted, waving with her phone.</p><p>On the walk home, the sky stretched velvet above the buildings. Mina meandered past the now-closed café where she’d met friends for endless cappuccinos, the corner market where she snagged the last bundle of toilet paper, the bookstore with a dusty “See you soon!” sign taped to the door. By the curb, a couple argued in low voices, hands in pockets, stepping apart as if touch itself were dangerous.</p><p>Up in her apartment, Mina stripped off her clothes and sanitized her phone, hands turning pink under the tap. She pulled open the window, letting in a chill blast of late-winter air. Somewhere far off, fireworks popped, or maybe it was just the distant crackle of a car backfire.</p><p>She set the tulips in a chipped vase and watched them sway. Their petals glowed stubbornly in the dim light.</p><p>Phone in hand, she scrolled a final time—photos from friends at empty bars, masked on buses, raising toasts in video grids. Someone tweeted, “See you all when we’re on the other side.”</p><p>Mina shut her eyes and imagined it: crowds returning, stoops thronged with voices, the gentle chaos of life. She felt the pulse of the city changing, held in one long, uncertain breath.</p><p>Tonight was the last ordinary night.</p><p>Tomorrow, the city would go silent. But tonight, it still belonged to her—a city paused, not yet unmade. In that lingering in-between, Mina stretched toward sleep, tulips silently blooming, and waited for the world to change.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/pandemic-stories/>Pandemic Stories</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-last-day-before-lockdown/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Last Day Before Lockdown</span>
