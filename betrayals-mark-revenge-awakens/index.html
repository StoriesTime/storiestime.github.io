They lived in harmony and stupidity, grateful for the sustenance the land provided them. Two factions were born from a traitor, one which harbored rage and one which embraced betrayal. The village spiraled into chaos, dividing its own people.</p><p>Aria, a young but resourceful healer, witnessed the division firsthand. Her life changed when she was bound to a curse, a consequence of betrayal she would never see coming. Her village has become a brute force, of bloodlust and despair.</p><p>It happened one fateful night when she was found unconscious outside her home after someone she trusted gave her a drugged drink. Aria awoke in a cavern, bound to an ancient suffering curse that wouldn&rsquo;t let her touch her own skin. She was aware of the lingering hate that pulsed through her very core. By night, she would see an affliction placed on her body that was eroding the soul within her. She now possessed the ability to feel the punishing trappings of betrayal which her one-time close friends inflicted upon her.</p><p>Her ancestral memories didn&rsquo;t fail her in these moments of despair. There was stumbling evil, one of her own blood, who set her up. For revenge, a path only widened by the daily torment she was forced to endure, she bore twisted whispers of a prophecy predicting one fated to bear the curse of Betrayal&rsquo;s Mark would right the wrongs and punish the evildoers.</p><p>Born from the treachery also came the village saviors, the elusive, mysterious Blue-Eyed Bandits. They operated like thieves within the night, striking quietly with a smokescreen of chaos and anachronic confusion.</p><p>She felt the pull of the village at night, drawn away by a desire to understand and change. She began to weave together a story, one that connected the paths of everyone touched by the curse. There were no coincidences, only malicious intent.</p><p>At the center lay the mastermind behind the torment clouding her peaceful life. Aria traced her lineage back to the one responsible, studying faces she had once trusted, passing years laying dormant in her memories with a plan.</p><p>As times passed, she joined forces with the Blue-Eyed Bandits, binding each member to her cause. Together, unspoken of course, they waged a stealth war defining the tempo of night in her wanton, blood-soaked hunt.</p><p>In the heart of ice and rock, Aria roamed in the name of her own brutal vengeance. Stealthily, she made her case, wielding profound excision, yelling at the very thought of injustice served against her. With each targeted move, the tide shifted.</p><p>Betrayal&rsquo;s Mark utilized her lineage&rsquo;s frightening, ancient powers to weaken key villages. Witnessing her strength slip away, doom grew in her eyes and the treacherous Villages of the South wanted this ingenuity to bear upon them all in due course.</p><p>As the legend goes, the White-Eyed Mages from deep within Whispering Mountain would rise against this power. Aria played her part, strengthening her ingenuity to maintain this balance for her own sick vengeance against a twisted darkness clinging beneath her.</p><p>The legend bore contradiction when Betty Peyntra pledged allegiance to the White-Eyed Mages, promising an even tighter bond against any who&rsquo;d shake their ground.</p><p>Aria had it all planned. Her heart sounded heavy, laden with the prophecy she bore. The clan of betrayal, her own flesh and blood, ensured her path which would scream with vengeful fire, without allowing peace.</p><p>In one final clash, Aria and the Blue-Eyed Bandits and the White-Eyed Mages confronted the Villages of the South in a battle for power. The true darkness of her own family foretold their plans to destroy the village she loved.</p><p>In the end, on the cruel altar of fate, Aria bound her lineage to her medieval ancestry for survival. Surveying the countless dead and blinding pain, her own revenge awakened as the true essence of Betrayal&rsquo;s Mark.</p><p>As prophecy turned reality, a new story of darkness unraveled in the village. Tempering the curse swelling within her soul, Aria relinquished the Betrayal&rsquo;s Mark to the heavens, consecrating her fare-purchased trip to redemption. The village would never be the same as a blurry peace returned with wit and the cold sting of betrayal.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/betrayal-and-revenge/>Betrayal and Revenge</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/betrayals-legacy-the-revenge-that-heals/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Betrayal's Legacy: The Revenge That Heals</span>
