Long before the town had grown and flourished into the thriving community it is today, the asylum stood as the bastion of despair and torment for the mentally ill.</p><p>Tales of agonizing screams and hallucinations still could be heard from the hospital, disturbing the tranquility of the town. Even years after its closure, the asylum&rsquo;s decked facade bore the testimony of desolation and promptly became the talk of the town.</p><p>As the years passed by, curiosity piqued by the surrounding darkness, two friends, Irene and Ava, ventured towards the abandoned asylum. Fueled by their relentless desire to explore the macabre, they embarked on the treacherous journey to unravel the secrets past.</p><p>Despite their mutual apprehension, they took the plunge, driven by their insatiable curiosity on what lay within the decrepit asylum walls. The sun was setting, casting dark shadows across the neglected structure. Creaking gates opened slowly, leading them into the sinister asylum, where rusted bars and tangled chains greeted them bitterly with the acrid smell of abandonment and decay.</p><p>As they entered cautiously into the asylum&rsquo;s dim corridors, a skeleton of what once stood echoed within the walls as they literally walked between the past and the present. Stains of blood marked the grotesque artistry on the peeling walls, while dangling aerial roots of ancient ivy interfered with their passing.</p><p>The friends stumbled upon the old hydrotherapy room; within lay a rusted tub, standing as ugly witness to countless torment faced by its victims. The room carried a chilling reminder of the cruel punishments inflicted upon the desperate souls there.</p><p>As the friends ventured nightward deeper into the asylum, mild fear crept within their hearts, palpable in the ever-diminishing sunlight that filtered through the broken windows. In one of the rooms, painted on the wall was a symbol known only too well in this psychiatric asylum; a grotesque illustration of The Serpent, a symbol of torment, suffering, and a female spirit that perhaps haunts the asylum.</p><p>The wind howled outside, mimicking the agonizing wails from the asylum’s tormented past. The piercing cries reverberated along the dilapidated corridors that resonated as if they were fresh. Flickering lightbulbs hung ominously but nevertheless, cast an eerie illumination on the atrocities that had taken place.</p><p>Irene and Ava had stumbled upon the asylum&rsquo;s morgue, a soulless place where countless lives had been terminated. Filing cabinets of forgotten souls surrounded them, highlighting the many rotting corpses kept in cold storage. The tang of formaldehyde filled the air, leaving their noses burning, as they stumbled upon remnants of brains and bones.</p><p>As their fate would have it, their expedition came face to face with an entity that had never left. From the shadows, an apparition emerged, revealing the tormented spirit of a female patient who had once resided in this very asylum. Known as Elizabeth, she was tortured for years by doctors who mistook her prophetic visions for mental instability.</p><p>As the chilling atmosphere of the asylum whispered through her retributions, Elizabeth’s silhouette began to shape with her haunting wails; a fearful experience that paralyzed the duo. It was as if they were thrust back into the asylum&rsquo;s tormented days, watching the atrocities unfold before their eyes.</p><p>Trembling, Irene and Ava retreated as they found their way out of the asylum. Their hearts pounding in unison, they managed to tear themselves away from the ghostly Elizabeth scrutinizing every step as they hastily left.</p><p>Years after their chilling encounter with the asylum, the memories of the bones and chains, and tortured souls haunted their dreams each night. Forever haunted by the labyrinthine corridors left behind by The Serpent and the grotesque portrayal of Elizabeth, their friendship grew strained under the weight of the specters that refused to be laid to rest.</p><p>The abandoned asylum, though reclaimed by time, whispered secrets of Elizabeth&rsquo;s enduring torment, allowing some to hear the agonizing scream that echoed throughout the night. The town of Bellingham, however, had long since then embraced progress and moved on, leaving behind remnants of its sinister past, yet some souls, like Elizabeth, were eternal, shackled echoes of trepidation and fear, reliving their tormented past in a macabre dance of despair and anguish.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/ghost-stories/>Ghost Stories</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/terrifying-ghost-stories-to-read-in-the-dark/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Terrifying Ghost Stories to Read in the Dark</span>
