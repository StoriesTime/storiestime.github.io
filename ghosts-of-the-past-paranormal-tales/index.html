There was a time when the great jusitia family presided over their lands with both strength and wisdom. Tours were conducted for the interested visitor to soak in the aura of this bygone era. However, these times have long since passed, and tales of old are what remains. The ghosts of the past continue to linger among the ruins of the manor, add a chilling air to the old town, and fuel the constant curiosity of the inhabitants in the neighboring village.</p><p>Ten centuries ago, the jusitia family was known for their wealth, influence, and cruelty. The farming villages under their rule prospered in terms of production and wealth, yet suffered under the weight of oppressive taxation and stern control. As the centuries passed, the family&rsquo;s rule mellowed, leaving behind only whispers of their past glory.</p><p>One such whisper consists of the last jusitia heir, Lady Silvia, a beloved child who discovered the true injustices inflicted upon their tenant farmers. Overcome with guilt and remorse, she vowed to amend the wrongs of her ancestors. Thus started her endeavor of restoring the rights and dignity of her humble villagers.</p><p>With the restructuring of the tenancy agreements, the villages flourished, and the jusitia manor prospered. Lady Silvia earned the respect and admiration of her people. However, she could not escape the weight of her lineage - the requirements of a Lord or Lady&rsquo;s role demanded a union with a high-ranking noble. Lady Silvia resorted to marrying a duke, feeling that she was sacrificing her beloved villagers as sure as her ancestors had.</p><p>Silvia&rsquo;s suitor was Ebino, the Duke of Dirtland, one of the most powerful and elite nobles in all the lands. Unbeknownst to Lady Silvia, Duke Ebino snuck into the jusitia manor with dark intent. Teaching the villagers the vile craft of witchcraft wielded by the Duke, the once-thriving villages plummeted into chaos. Silvia, trapped by her duty and obedience to her husband, was slowly isolated, succumbing to her detrimental lineage.</p><p>Upon Lady Silvia&rsquo;s death, her hatred and rebellion against her line didn&rsquo;t cease. Her specter remains among the ruined manor, the hollow ruins of Jusitia&rsquo;s legacy. A source of mystery and curiosity for the locals, she weaves in and out of the present world. She grips the cold hand of each perplexed and confounded village-visitor.</p><p>Still, she stands guard, protecting the land and her people with all the love and loyalty she could not afford in life. Lady Silvia, bound to the will of her ancestors and doomed by her benevolence, seeks to appease the chaos She discovers in her domain and maintain the integrity of her land&rsquo;s past. She yearns for a time when the jusitia family was correct in their ways, embracing both her lineage&rsquo;s vindictive history and the goodness she yearned to inherit.</p><p>The hollow echoes of her gentle whispers to the village inhabitant&rsquo;s prod and connect people to the world unseen. The remnants of the jusitia manor echo with the harmony that was once lost and gained back. The ghost of Lady Silvia yearns to save her village from the darkness that broods within its walls, the shadows cast by her family&rsquo;s name.</p><p>Today, you may walk among the ruins of the jusitia manor and hear the faint whispers of the past. With each step, you&rsquo;ll be attracted to the stories of a once-great line and the girl named Silvia, who found redemption in the folds of her intimidating legacy.</p><p>In these rambling shadows, the lonely ghost of Lady Silvia waits. With time, she hopes to forgive and be forgiven for the sins of her bloodline. And in the hidden corners of the jusitia manor, her whispered lyrics will guide the lost villages. Until that time of redemption comes, she will dwell and search for solace. The ghosts of the past, tethered to the land, dance silently across the winding paths of the old town, awaiting the whispers to cease.</p><p>As you explore the dilapidated halls of the jusitia manor, you can feel the weight of history and the eternal search for redemption. For, in these abandoned walls, there exists a story both thrilling and sorrowful - a tale of a village haunted by its past, guided by a benevolent ghost seeking peace.</p><p>Just as the town&rsquo;s forgotten roads may lead some to life&rsquo;s answers, so will the whispers of the jusitia manor lead you to discover the truth about this village&rsquo;s enchanted past.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/supernatural-and-paranormal/>Supernatural and Paranormal</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/ghosts-of-the-past-haunting-short-stories/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Ghosts of the Past: Haunting Short Stories</span>
