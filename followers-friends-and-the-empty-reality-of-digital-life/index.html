His apartment, small and unassuming, was bathed in the blue glow of his monitor. Cupboards stuffed with instant ramen and coffee grounds were a testament to his solo existence. On his desk sat his laptop, humming faintly, adorned with stickers that pretended to exhibit personality—a cracked emblem of his favorite streaming service, the silhouette of a space rocket. His phone buzzed incessantly next to him, but the vibration felt routine now, as monotonous as background noise.</p><p>One hundred retweets. Five hundred likes. Three thousand followers and growing. Darren should’ve been thrilled. His recent tweet—a dry joke about the absurdity of daylight savings—had struck the perfect chord. The masses loved it, or so it seemed. Thousands of strangers had paused whatever they were doing to click a little heart. A few had even taken the time to reply, many of them with laughing emojis or variations of “So true!”</p><p>“You’re killing it, man!” texted Andrea, his old college friend turned digital marketing guru.</p><p>Yet, Darren felt nothing. Worse than nothing—a kind of hollowness that gnawed at his ribs, leaving him restless. It wasn’t that he didn’t appreciate the attention. He did. He’d spent years trying to cultivate it: tweaking his bio, posting at optimal times for engagement, crafting every tweet like a miniature essay. He’d climbed steadily, first to a thousand followers, then five thousand, and now, as he neared the ten-thousand threshold, all he could feel was this incomprehensible dull ache.</p><p>He clicked back to the tweet. Replies flooded the thread like eager swimmers at the beach. A jokester had shared an image of a clock splattered with comic sans text. Another follower invited him to join a podcast about the quirks of modern life. A handful of verified accounts had retweeted. Darren refreshed the page obsessively, even though there was no longer anything to be gained. It was like staring at a slot machine, expecting a jackpot you’d already won.</p><hr><p>Darren had plenty of friends—or so he told himself. Online connections were real connections, weren’t they? He had Andrea, whose advice about algorithms and hashtags had been crucial to his growth. He had Caleb, a fellow tech nerd who often shared collaborative articles over Discord. There were also his regular commenters and frequent retweeters—the user with the anime avatar, the sarcastic parent whose humor bordered on grim, the aspiring songwriter from the Midwest. What did it matter that Darren had only spoken to most of them through a few lines of text? Communication was communication.</p><p>Still, there were moments when he craved something quieter, something unstructured and alive. Once, months ago, he’d nearly worked up the courage to ask Andrea to grab a coffee ‘in real life,’ as everyone still awkwardly referred to it now. But the phrase itself—the dusty implication that one life was somehow more authentic than another—had stopped him. Would she want to? Would <em>he</em> even want to? Darren wasn’t sure. Maybe it was easier to leave this friendship untainted, untouched, a perfect series of glowing interactions, uninterrupted by weather or awkward silences.</p><hr><p>When Darren&rsquo;s follower count broke ten thousand, the milestone arrived not with the fireworks he&rsquo;d imagined but with an empty &ldquo;ding&rdquo; from his phone. He stared at the notification, waiting for some swell of joy, some sense of accomplishment. None came. Beneath the number—a clean &ldquo;10K&rdquo; instead of the messy string of digits that had existed short days before—Darren saw nothing more than a rounded abstraction.</p><p>That night, the blue glow of Darren&rsquo;s screen felt harsher than usual. He needed air. For the first time in weeks, he slid his coat off the back of his chair and walked out the door. The streets looked alien at night. He passed dogs pulling impatient owners, restaurants flickering with neon promises, bus stops unspooling lines of cold-faced commuters. It occurred to him, bizarrely, that he hadn&rsquo;t seen this corner of town, these faces, up close in over two months. What was it about the outside world that felt so strange to him now?</p><p>Forty-seven notifications by the time he returned home. Darren responded to each as if on autopilot: a GIF here, a casual thank-you there. Every interaction felt heavy in its falseness, like leaving a voicemail for ghosts.</p><p>It had started small, this curiously empty life. A tweet here, a post there, a bubbling stream of lighthearted commentary. Darren hadn&rsquo;t thought much of it at first. But too many days passed under an artificial sun, and too many connections grew rooted in fleeting pairs of sentences.</p><hr><p>When Darren woke up the next day, his hands were trembling slightly as he checked his phone. He had massive engagement from a new tweet—this one about overpriced coffee mugs at department stores. A brand had messaged him, offering free gear in exchange for a shout-out. Darren stared at the statistics. It was, by far, the most successful tweet he had ever made.</p><p>Still, the aching hollowness returned, quicker now, like a reflex. Why didn&rsquo;t this feel better?</p><p>The answer, when it arrived, came without ceremony. Darren sat on his couch with the phone still in his palm, breathing deeply, the glossy screen refusing to let him go. None of it was real. Not the connections, not the admiration, not even the numbers stamped beside his name.</p><p>Sure, the people were real. They existed somewhere, typing from kitchens or bedrooms in cities Darren had never been to. But what was it they saw when they clicked &ldquo;Follow&rdquo;? A version of Darren who was neat, curated, a product designed for consumption. The bits of his personality that mattered most—his late-night musings, his awkward gait, his slight stutter when he was nervous—would never find their way onto anyone&rsquo;s timeline. He wasn’t himself here. Just a silhouette stitched together by profitable fragments.</p><p>Darren thought about Andrea. He thought about Caleb. He thought about the user with the anime avatar, the sarcastic parent, the songwriter from the Midwest. Could he call them friends? Did they <em>know</em> anything about him? Did he know anything about them? What if he disappeared tomorrow, his account wiped clean, every follower dropped to zero? Would anyone notice?</p><p>That night, Darren closed his laptop and didn’t reopen it for hours, then days. Time stretched in strange, unfamiliar shapes. The silence was unbearable; then it wasn’t. The absence of notifications felt like abandonment; then it didn’t.</p><p>Every now and then, Darren thought about the hollow ache, the phantom sensation of his buzzed phone. He wondered if there was still something worth chasing within the digital hinterlands—not followers, not likes, not validation, but something deeper. Something real. Maybe not. Maybe so.</p><p>For now, Darren walked outside, pulled his coat close, and felt the cold.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/social-media-and-digital-life/>Social Media and Digital Life</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/followers-or-friends-the-truth-behind-social-media-connections/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Followers or Friends?
