There’s a hum beneath it—ancient wind turbines tough enough to outlast their architects, the chirr of insects reclaiming untamed skyscrapers, rain ticking against the glass. Somewhere, something metallic gives way, disturbing the pigeons fattened on the husks of the Anthropocene. For Mira Santos, such sounds are company, perhaps even conversation. She wakes in her cocoon of blankets, tangled on the twentieth floor of the Grand Mariner Residences, the only high-rise still standing this close to Lake Ontario. Sometimes, she wakes expecting to hear voices. She knows she won’t.</p><p>Seven thousand, eight hundred and forty-two days—she marks them in her battered notebook, each a labor of will, a slab in the monument she builds to herself. The world has been empty for twenty-one and a half years.</p><p>She begins mornings with rituals: the solar kettle humming on the window ledge, iodine pills added to the lake water, teeth brushed with bristles cut from wild grass. She picks through what’s left of human technology, scavenged and reengineered, merged into objects no child was ever taught to use. Generators modified to burn biomass, drones whose software she patched together from fragments of code, an old satellite phone eternally scanning for a signal.</p><p>Every morning, Mira charts her survival: food, fuel, data. Every morning, Mira accepts—of course, there are no incoming calls.</p><h2 id=scavenging-through-the-hollow-city>Scavenging Through the Hollow City</h2><p>Toronto—once a living city—has become a museum curated by time and density. Ivy climbs glass towers. Wild dogs, lean and shy, roam in packs, occasionally trailing her for scraps. Sometimes she tosses them freeze-dried meat from the emergency caches—a transactional peace. The wild has claimed everything human hands released: city gardens thick as jungles, subway tunnels claimed by water and roots, intersections blooming with sunflowers and dandelions.</p><p>Mira’s route is mapped to the atom. She raids the rooftop greenhouses she&rsquo;d seeded years ago with tomatoes, kale, mutant peppers designed to flourish in acid soil. In the financial district, solar panels glimmer like insect wings. She logs every resource: electrical charge, water filtered, calories scavenged from collapsed supermarkets. She catalogues the changing world—the algae overtaking the lake, the waterline inching higher, the ice storms arriving earlier each winter.</p><p>Her favorite destination: the Toronto Reference Library. Each week, she delivers herself there as a pilgrim would—stepping through shattered glass doors to run her hands across spines with the reverence of the bereaved. There, Mira reads histories of civilizations extinguished, medical manuals, scavenged e-books, the stories of her kind.</p><p>She doesn’t read for joy, not anymore. She reads because she must outthink everything that still wants her dead.</p><h2 id=the-silence-between-heartbeats>The Silence Between Heartbeats</h2><p>Some nights, when the wind comes off the lake and echoes through the empty elevator shafts, Mira pulls out the Archive. Its pages are waterproof, rebound from old university lab notebooks. On each, she writes the things she can’t risk forgetting: edible mushroom identification, wind turbine maintenance, first aid for infected wounds, last known locations of batteries and seeds. Notes scrawled to the person she used to be, or to anyone who may ever read it—though she doubts deeply that anyone ever will.</p><p>She writes stories, sometimes, when the dread seeps through. Chimeric fictions in which the Collapse never happened, or rescue ships come with the sunrise, or a friend’s voice rings over the satellite radio. Sometimes she invents company: the gentle sarcasm of Ivan, whom she met in undergrad; her mother’s piano scales echoing through their old apartment in Scarborough. Fantasy, but vital as clean water.</p><h2 id=when-everything-changed>When Everything Changed</h2><p>“When was the moment?” she asks herself, often. Was it the dying off of insects, the hours spent tracing invisible disease through tangled maps on the internet, government voices dissolving into static? Or was it slower—a horizon always receding, until she woke one morning to realize the city was empty of all but its last caretaker?</p><p>The real answer: the human world ended not with a bang but with a sullen, protracted hush.</p><p>At first, she raided radio towers and repeater stations, jury-rigging antennas that clawed across continents. She sent messages in every language she knew, practiced the voices of lost friends so she’d remember how to speak. No one ever said her name back.</p><h2 id=solitude-and-terrors>Solitude and Terrors</h2><p>Loneliness was never a single event, but a siege. At first, she filled notebooks with experiments, proof that she could survive: crops, catchments, solar tools, a hydroponics rig built in a high-rise stairwell. But each year, even victory felt hollow—her successes unshared, unremarked. She grew used to speaking aloud, narrating daily tasks, filling the silence so it wouldn’t devour her sanity.</p><p>Fear was constant. Fear of dying alone, of injury or illness with no help to call for. That she might simply forget how to be a person—no face to mirror, no hand to hold. Even dreams haunted her, peopled with crowds whose faces she could no longer place.</p><p>But she adapted. She learned new songs, greeted wild creatures by name, built rituals for grief and joy and rage.</p><h2 id=signs-of-life>Signs of Life</h2><p>In her third decade alone, something shifted. For weeks, Mira caught patterns in the drone footage—subtle, uncanny arrangements in the parks, a scrawl of circles and lines, new stacks of stones along the waterfront path. At first she blamed animals, wind, or the play of the seasons.</p><p>Then, one evening in late October, while tending her rooftop garden, Mira saw movement: not dog, not deer, not scavenger bird. A limb—human, emerging from the shattered glass of a bus shelter.</p><p>She froze. Unbelieving. Wary and wild as any coyote.</p><p>“Hello?” she called, in a dozen languages.</p><p>Hello, said the silence. But nothing more.</p><h2 id=the-search>The Search</h2><p>For weeks, Mira became a predator of hope, tracking the mystery. She analyzed footprints, watched for changes in the foraged caches she left behind as bait. She hung infrared cameras on bus stops, overgrown trails, entrances to the transit system. Each morning she reviewed film with trembling anticipation.</p><p>There: a fleeting silhouette, gone almost as soon as the lens caught her. Small, hunched, cautious—a human, or something like.</p><p>Mira adjusted her routines. She expanded her perimeter, venturing deeper into collapsed neighborhoods, leaving caches of food and notes at strategic sites. “You are not alone,” she wrote, again and again, in block script.</p><h2 id=a-second-survivor>A Second Survivor</h2><p>It was in the depths of winter, with the city entombed by freezing rain, that Mira finally saw her—drawn by a cache of canned beans stacked by the old ROM. The newcomer was gaunt, clad in layers of faded clothing, brandishing a sharpened pole as if expecting wolves.</p><p>They regarded each other across thirty feet of crusted ice.</p><p>“Name,” croaked Mira, voice hoarse with disuse.</p><p>The girl tilted her head, wordless.</p><p>Slowly, Mira pulled off her hat, raised her empty hands, recited the old greeting: “May I share a fire with you?”</p><p>After nearly two decades, Mira remembered how hope felt: electric, animal, dangerous. The girl nodded.</p><p>They were two sparks in a world gone to ash.</p><h2 id=the-language-of-survival>The Language of Survival</h2><p>Her name was Akemi. She was fifteen, unmoored, raised by silence and stories scavenged from recordings and books. For two weeks, their conversations were halting—a lexicon rebuilt from pictures, gestures, fragments of English and Japanese. Mira taught Akemi how to repair the water filters, what weeds to avoid. In turn, Akemi showed her how to lure crows, how to strip wire from the gutted fiber-optic cables, how to keep nightmares at bay.</p><p>They rebuilt Mira’s garden, harvested fish and windfallen apples, traded stories as currency. Akemi didn’t remember her parents, only the echo of lullabies and the taste of evaporated milk. Mira told her about subways that once ran around the clock, about bookstores, concerts, street food on Spadina in spring.</p><p>Each night, they shared the Archive. Each night, the story of the last human became the story of two.</p><h2 id=the-new-world>The New World</h2><p>Together, Mira and Akemi explored farther. With twice the labor, their stores doubled. With two minds, problems had solutions. Mira heard jokes again—sly, awkward, vital. Akemi learned to read, scribbled questions in the margins. They debated whether to cross the continent, to seek others, but decided, for now, Toronto was their home.</p><p>Together, they built a signal beacon far taller than Mira could manage alone, programmed it to broadcast in every language the world had spoken. On solar days, sometimes, they picked up faint echoes: static, hints of music, scraps of what might be human voices from somewhere half a globe away.</p><p>It was enough. Enough to believe, perhaps, that the world was not finished.</p><h2 id=the-ghosts-in-the-machine>The Ghosts in the Machine</h2><p>Sometimes, as spring broke over the ruins, Mira wondered at their new mythologies. What would Akemi’s children—if there ever were more—remember of this age? Would the Collapse be a cautionary tale, or a half-remembered fever dream, a flood as far-off as Atlantis? Would their descendants envy the abundance lost, or detest the arrogance that had ended it?</p><p>In the quiet, with the Archive between them, they built a new calendar. Day One: the day two humans became a world again.</p><p>Life was not what it had been. It was smaller, slower, more brittle—and yet, in an odd way, more luminous. Every laughter was brighter for its rarity, every sunrise celebrated. Mira had spent half a lifetime managing what was left of history. She wondered, sometimes, if she would be remembered. Whether somewhere—on the other hemisphere, across shattered continents—the story of the last human had begun the story of firsts anew.</p><p>And in the ache of that question, as wildflowers claimed the city, she learned to endure not just for survival, but for the possibility that after darkness, life—somehow—persists.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/science-fiction/>Science Fiction</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-last-human-colony-survival-on-a-dying-planet/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Last Human Colony: Survival on a Dying Planet</span>
