Hazel stood at her window, coffee in hand, watching the sun claim narrow strips along the row of brick apartments opposite. The news had come in fits and starts for weeks, but last night’s letter from her landlord carved the unknown into certainty—midnight would mark the beginning of something uncharted.</p><p>Her toes curled on the cold floor, nerves wrapped in anticipation and an unspoken fear. Today was for errands, emails, and phone calls. But the rules had relaxed, just for a moment, letting everyone breathe before the city held its breath. Hazel set her cup down and reached for her phone, drawn to the surge of group messages flooding in.</p><p><em>Let’s meet for brunch,</em> her friend Gabriel had written. <em>One last time?</em></p><p>The usual crowd, a circle of seven who’d made the city home, was gathering at their regular spot: Lila’s Cafe, a chameleon of a place that was sometimes a bakery, often a study hall, always a haven. Hazel pulled on a sweater, tied up her hair, and stepped into the cool corridor, the walls already echoing with the hush of impending isolation.</p><p>On the street, life moved in cautious bursts. Masks bobbed on chins and in pockets. Vendors arranged crates of apples and late-season tomatoes, their calls more subdued than sharp. Car horns sounded like anxious reminders—move along, there’s not much time.</p><p>She walked the five blocks to Lila’s, drinking in details that usually blurred past: the bronze plaque beside the library’s door, the icy rinse of air from the pastry shop, the busker’s battered guitar. Everyone walked a little slower, as if they believed dragging their feet could keep the moment suspended.</p><p>The cafe’s bell rang out as Hazel pushed the door, and a hush fell over the familiar faces. Gabriel waved, quicksilver smile dimmed by the weight of the day. The others—Jo, Camila, Sai, Mark, and Lila herself—filled the mismatched chairs around two pushed-together tables. Someone had already ordered pancakes, their syrup-laced scent clinging to the air.</p><p>They fell into chatter that tried hard to be ordinary. Jo and Camila debated their favourite book adaptations with frantic cheer; Mark recounted his latest failed sourdough experiment. Hazel noticed the way hands lingered a beat longer on coffee cups, the way laughter caught in throats and flared out too brightly. Everyone eyed their phones, waiting for another update, another edict, another line drawn.</p><p>Lila, the cafe owner, swept over with a pot of coffee. Her hands were steady, her gaze gentle. “On the house,” she said. “Don’t know when I’ll pour another cup for you all. So I’ll pour this one strong.”</p><p>Hazel’s mug steamed against her palm, grounding her in the now. “Thank you,” she murmured.</p><p>Sai glanced up, his eyes flickering above his mask. “Do you remember our first brunch here? Four years ago?”</p><p>The memory filled the circle. Moving into town together, lost and loud, stumbling into Lila’s when rain drove them from the park. That day, like this one, the city felt bright and impossible, a place awaiting invention. Back then, loneliness hung over them like fog, but laughter delivered them into friendship.</p><p>Camila traced a finger over the edge of her napkin. “Feels like ages ago. Everything was… simple.”</p><p>“Not simple,” Jo said, “but we could touch things without thinking about it. Or each other.”</p><p>Gabriel’s grin softened. “Touching things is overrated anyway.” He drew an invisible mustache in the air, miming the days when he’d shake everyone’s hand and then regret it.</p><p>The table leaned into nostalgia, trading small stories of bus rides, endless nights on rooftops, sunrise at the waterfront. Beneath the surface, every word turned reverent, marking the end of casual togetherness.</p><p>Lila topped off everyone’s coffee. “I’ll keep the lights on,” she said. “You come by when this is all over. I’ll know it’s you if you knock twice and demand a croissant.”</p><p>Hazel found herself gripping her phone tighter, a little afraid of the hours tumbling by. The group’s rituals—birthday pancakes, communal deadlines, impromptu dinners—had been their anchor in the drift of city life. Now Hazel wondered if distance from each other would echo louder than the silence outside.</p><p>She realized she was staring. The room thinned as people trickled out, the usual weekday rush evaporated into caution. A ragged sign in the window promised takeout, maybe, as long as Lila’s flour and hope held out.</p><p>They lingered until the sky threatened rain. Mark reached for his backpack, then shrugged, guilty. “Gotta run. Need to stock up on cat food before people remember their cats eat too.”</p><p>Jo groaned. “Don’t make me add ‘stealing food from Mark’s cat’ to my post-pandemic crime résumé.”</p><p>Gabriel quipped, “Survival of the friendliest!” and that was the cue for all of them to leave. They paused outside, wind whipping up the street, each quieted by their own thoughts.</p><p>By unspoken agreement, they walked together toward the park, a little parade of mismatched jackets and noise. Hazel looked up at budding trees, half-deep in wakefulness, and wondered what the world would look like when spring was finished with it.</p><p>They said goodbye at the park gates, careful now. Some hugs, some awkward bows, some waves. There was no script for this, only sudden awareness of habit—what to do with hands, how far to stand.</p><p>Hazel turned toward home, foot dragging. Even her neighborhood felt unfamiliar, the glow of each window strange and intimate all at once.</p><hr><p>Inside, she ordered groceries online, her clicks echoing through a barren kitchen. Next, she called her parents, their voices calm and certain, untouchable in a small town hundreds of miles away. She could hear her mother, always hopeful, reeling off recipe ideas for a time when flour and eggs might be scarce.</p><p>“You’ll be fine,” her father said, half joking. “Just stay inside, read a book, complain on the Internet. You’re good at all three.”</p><p>It made her smile. It didn’t make the rooms any less empty.</p><p>After lunch, the group chat erupted again, full of links—concert livestreams, museum tours, a pizza recipe for no yeast. Sai posted a photo of the park, sunlight breaking through trees, and Hazel felt the urge to walk again, to catch the city’s minor chords.</p><p>Masks on, shoes laced, she went out one last time.</p><p>She circled the block, noting the lines at the pharmacy and the shuttered barbershop, the sympathetic nods from passersby. Something gentle lived in the air, a kind of fragile cohesiveness, the sort rarely named but often lost.</p><p>Hazel climbed a short flight of stone steps, settled on the edge of the square, and warmed her hands in her sleeves. Around her, caffeine-laced teenagers and solitary dog walkers sprawled out, hungry for open sky. Everyone was there with their own urge—grasping at the day, hoarding sunlight as insurance.</p><p>Across the square, an elderly man played a battered violin, bow sliding gentle arcs into dusk. His music, a wandering piece from another century, tangled through the cold air. Hazel closed her eyes, letting each note stitch her to the present, the city’s dormant heart beating one last time.</p><p>She watched a child, no more than eight, skate the periphery of the square, every circle a dare to normalcy. The child’s laughter, unburdened, sailed above the hush, knitting the scattered listeners into an audience of strangers.</p><p>Hazel thought of her grandmother, who’d survived war and exile, who used to say, <em>“You gather yourself in the waiting. That’s where hope starts.”</em></p><p>At sunset, the city glowed in soft focus—shop windows spilled amber light, the sky wove bruised pastels, shadows blurred into alleys. From every balcony, people leaned outward, breathing the last collective night, unmasked and fragile.</p><p>Hazel walked home in the blue hush. She stopped by her downstairs neighbor, Mrs. Singh, who met her with a cautious smile.</p><p>“Do you need anything?” Hazel asked. “I have some extra peanut butter. And pasta.”</p><p>Mrs. Singh’s hands fluttered. “You are very kind, dear. I am okay for now. I will miss the noise. It keeps me young.”</p><p>Hazel nodded. “We’ll bring the noise back.” Under the circumstances, it sounded like the truest promise she could make.</p><p>By eight o’clock, the sky spilled indigo. Hazel moved through her apartment, stacking books, checking batteries, pacing nervously. The city outside began to hush, windows lighting up like constellations. Discovering she couldn’t sit still, she set up her old record player and let vinyl hiss through the hush.</p><p>Midnight drew near on little cat feet. Hazel pulled a chair to the window, phone at the ready, notifications piling up. The group was live-streaming—a tiny square of faces, each in their own secluded world, glasses raised to empty rooms.</p><p>“To the next time,” Camila said, earnest and raw.</p><p>“To noise,” Mark added.</p><p>“To croissants,” Gabriel grinned.</p><p>Hazel lifted her cup. “To waiting together, apart.”</p><p>Outside, the clock struck twelve. Sirens lifted, then fell again. The air felt untouched, pausing between breaths. She watched as the lights across the street blinked off, one by one, until the night held only the hush of possibility.</p><p>Hazel sat back, the city at her feet, the world spinning into strange quiet. She let herself hope that when the doors creaked open, when friends gathered around tables sticky with syrup, the city would remember this—the day they said goodbye, not to each other, but to the shape of life as it had been, together always, even when apart.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/pandemic-stories/>Pandemic Stories</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-last-breath-pandemic-chronicles/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Last Breath: Pandemic Chronicles</span>
