It was whispered among mortal men that in the dim recesses of this sacred copse, the goddess of love and beauty first emerged from the frothy embrace of the foam-born sea, rising naked and siren-like to weave her enchantments on the hearts of mankind. Many a pilgrim would journey hither to solicit blessings of passion from the temperamental deity whose unpredictable caprice could render any mortal ensnared by the power of love.</p><p>But on a scorching midsummer eve, as the moon ascended her throne above the ancient olive grove that hugged the verdant slopes, an event of celestial import unfolded in the shadow of Aphrodite&rsquo;s hallowed bower. It was Easteros, a young shepherd from nearby Chora, who first beheld the spectacle as he returned homeward with his flock under the silvered canopy of branches.</p><p>His dusty feets had carried him far, and his woolly charges moved languidly beneath the withering heat when, from an unexpected fissure in the limestone bluffs behind the sanctuary, there unfurled a ghastly apparition. A stream of pallid smoke coiled from the jagged crevice, and from its ouroboros-like coils, a shape began to materialize: a figure, draped in hooded robes, whose face was veiled behind a mask of ebony lacquer wrought in the likeness of the Lady of Love herself. The spectral acolyte advanced down the grove&rsquo;s precipitous path, steadily descending toward the heart of the cultic grove, whither devout pilgrims had recently begun to congregate to exalt and honor their capricious patroness.</p><p>Easteros stood entranced, his bleating flock forgotten, as the masked figure wended its eerie way through the dense ranks of cypress and myrtle. Strangely, none of the assembled worshippers appeared to take any notice of the interloper; rather, they bustled in customary disarray, weaving through the primordial arboreal landscape, each pilgrimage bringing new revelers to lay yellowing reeds of suppliance at the base of a marble column where ludic rites were wont to commence. The air smelled thick of thyme, sage, and the cloying perfume of roses; an intoxicating aroma that seemed to both delight and repel the masked visitor as it swirled around her, pulsing in syncopation with the low moan of the Great Blue Heron that cried from its sentinel-post atop the grove&rsquo;s tallest, most ancient oak.</p><p>As the spectral courier drew nigh, her enigmatic gait came to a sudden halt, the dark lacquer of her mask glinting in the shimmering lunar rays that leaked down through the dappled canopy above. Hips swaying, she turned to face the excited crowd. Instantly, silence descended upon them like a heavy quilt, stifling speech, extinguishing laughter, and stilling even the wind that sighed distantly through the garden of Aphrodite.</p><p>It was the Mother&rsquo;s voice that broke the quiet, clear and melodic as the first dawn song of larks. &ldquo;Seek not my presence, sister,&rdquo; she intoned, the word &lsquo;sister&rsquo; etching itself into Easteros&rsquo; memory as though traced in molten gold.</p><p>With breathless anticipation, the shepherd dared to venture closer, his boots miring in a patch of dew-slick grass; despite his pulchritudinous name, &lsquo;Easteros&rsquo; was well accustomed to anonymity, and frequently found himself the onlooker, rather than the object, of the maddening ardor borne of the goddess&rsquo;s mysterious machinations.</p><p>&ldquo;I come bearing counsel and consequence, sweet Aphrodite,&rdquo; said the masked stranger. Yet rather than impudence, her tone bespoke respect, perhaps even reverence, as she ceremoniously proffered a small enameled coffer with jeweled clasps that glinted beneath the silvery patina of moonlight. Through the vellum-thin membrane of her mask, her eyes — whether of silver, or charoal, or the richest sapphire — were lost to the darkness that shrouded her countenance, and Easteros could not thereafter discern their hue or lustre.</p><p>&ldquo;What counsel do you offer me?&rdquo; asked Aphrodite, the timbre of her voice dripping with para bellum provocatīonis, ripe with the invitation she had widely broadcast to all those who sought her favor.</p><p>&ldquo;My lady,&rdquo; the stranger answered, bowing with uncharacteristic grace for one of otherworldly origin, slim fingers caressing the enameled coffer, &ldquo;your power is absolute. Love is your dominion, and we are merely pawns in your divine game. Yet thou must know that even the most puissant of players is doomed should their tactics prove insufficient. I bring thee a means to preserve thy dominion, to transcend thy capricious nature, and to cement thy sovereignty over all of love&rsquo;s chaos.&rdquo;</p><p>Aphrodite, shifting an elegant hip against the cold marble of her column, smirked. &ldquo;A bold claim, Meredith. Lay thy burden.&rdquo;</p><p>Meredith—who thus unbekled herself with her real name—opened the glowing casket to reveal a most peculiar artifact: a crescent moon of unmarked quartz, its smooth, silvery surface marred by swirling streaks of grey and violet, encased within an ornate locket suspended by a fine chain of gold so old it bore the patina of time. Her eyes alighting upon it, Aphrodite&rsquo;s once cloudless visage darkened; she was robbed of speech.</p><p>&ldquo;This &lsquo;gift,&rsquo; as you term it,&rdquo; she hissed, &ldquo;smacks of betrayal and treachery. What purpose do you intend for my heart, to ensnare and govern me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A greater purpose than you can imagine, my sister,&rdquo; Meredith laughed. &ldquo;For thou hath truly been the monarch of Love&rsquo;s impermanent realm, thy sway as transient. Love is but a power to be wielded, not to be constrained by the frailties of intoxication and ruin. Here lies the pearl of undying and undemanding ardor. Secure it within thine heart and, henceforth, thou wilt never hunger to ensnare nor relish the sweet agony of worry, for the passion thou begot heretofore will do so evermore.&rdquo;</p><p>To all gathered in the watchful shadows, the events seemed to stutter; indeed, only Easteros among mortals perceived the cunning embedded in the acoustic webbing that Meredith had cast. He saw how Meredith had adjusted her Grecian robes to reveal the sapphiric locket of the crescent moon, baited; and how her eyes remained fixed upon Aphrodite&rsquo;s; trapped within the confluence of expectations and reticence. Performing the sorceress&rsquo;s magic—yet it was ultimately the work of her own heart. The luminous orb in her hand, but a mere irrelevance.</p><p>Aphrodite hesitated for a long moment, her eyes flickering between the locket and the shifting cloud overhead. &ldquo;Why dost thou offer this to me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because I wish to ensure the undying breath of love&rsquo;s eternal reign,&rdquo; Meredith humbly confessed. &ldquo;Because I am sickened by the quagmire of strife and havoc thou hast nurtured with wanton abandon. I could not consort with thee in mind and heart whilst you persisted in your destructive and decadent folly. To preserve the very essence of passion, and subdue the bloodlust for dominion and control, thou must be bound by a love that knoweth no ending, thus ensuring that thou shalt retain thy power and never be sullied by sorrow.&rdquo;</p><p>And so said, so done; hook, line, and sinker. Mystified, the Mater Amorum accepted the gift and graced Meredith’s neck with the locket. Their breaths interlaced; breaths that hummed with fateful potency, replete with lunar whispers, with avertigo, and bedevotion. Unwavering eyes locked gazes, their worlds intertwined in silent devotion. The strings of destiny were woven, merged, and marred—Aphrodite and her masked adversary bound in a unique, eternal love.</p><p>The enigmatic goddess, driven to make her pate&rsquo;s personal desires matter, now pledged her heart to him who vowed her undoing. Rufus tendrils of stalwart acceptance, hers would be but a single beat of undying love; a song that sprang from the mortal mind, the mastermind behind the mask. The grove no longer breathed with the uncertain shimmer of hope; it sang with power and certainty—of a love that could never perish, nor decay, entwined in an unending bond.</p><p>Beside himself with imaginative fervor, the Shepherd of Chora, Easteros, gathered his flock and quietly made his sonorous exit. Therein lay the tale of a deceiver&rsquo;s deception and masterminds entwined, where brittle dreams shattered, and love reigned from moonlit heights of undying ardor.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/robbery-and-heists/>Robbery and Heists</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/amber-vault-haul-the-legend-of-the-undetected-thief/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Amber Vault Haul: The Legend of the Undetected Thief</span>
