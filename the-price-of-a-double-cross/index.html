Gideon Black leaned over his desk, his fingers weaving intricate patterns as they toyed with a dull letter opener. The bland, gray décor—meant to inspire productivity—offered little solace for someone trying to dodge the avalanche of mistakes he&rsquo;d unknowingly unleashed.</p><p>Across from him, Detective Evelyn Marks sat with her notebook open, her piercing hazel eyes never straying from his face. She was a veteran investigator—the kind who could smell dishonesty before a person even spoke. Gideon forced his lips into a casual smile, but his heart thudded like a runaway train.</p><p>&ldquo;So, Mr. Black,&rdquo; Evelyn began smoothly, the corners of her mouth curling upward in a half-smile. &ldquo;You claim to have no knowledge of the missing shipment.&rdquo; Her gaze flickered to the dusty window behind him, revealing just enough sunlight to hint at freedom outside.</p><p>&ldquo;I don’t claim anything,&rdquo; Gideon snapped, his words coated in artificial bravado. &ldquo;I told you—I signed paperwork, moved it like the higher-ups asked, and went home. What someone does after that isn’t my business.&rdquo;</p><p>Evelyn tilted her head, her expression neutral but calculating. She scratched at the paper with her pen, though Gideon suspected she wasn’t taking thorough notes—just playing mind games, waiting for him to falter.</p><p>The truth was, she already knew. Evelyn Marks rarely asked questions she didn’t have answers to, but she wanted to hear Gideon say it. She wanted the full admission, the unraveling of his poorly stitched lies. The problem was, Gideon had gambled everything to ensure no one learned of his betrayal—even her.</p><hr><p>Three months ago, Gideon wasn’t this paranoid, jittery man sitting under the weight of Evelyn’s scrutiny. He was just another cog in the wheel of Quantum Transit, a shipping company that prided itself on discretion. But discretion came with opportunities, and Gideon wasn’t blind to them. Working in logistics meant knowing where every shipment came from, where it was headed, and whether anyone cared to check the finer details.</p><p>It started small—re-routing boxes of designer watches, pocketing a few dollars on the side from shady buyers in the market. Then came the bigger temptations: pharmaceuticals, rare antiques, and substances most people never dared speak of. So long as Gideon swept the transactions under the radar, no one asked questions. Until they did.</p><p>One ordinary Tuesday morning, Benton Reese strolled into Quantum Transit’s dimly-lit warehouse. Benton worked security, but not in the usual &ldquo;badge-and-a-gun&rdquo; style. He was a fixer—a man whose job it was to keep secrets buried deep and problems erased before they smelled like scandals. He’d smiled at Gideon that day, a slow, dangerous grin that hinted at just how much dirt he’d unearthed about the quiet logistics coordinator.</p><p>&ldquo;I hear you’ve been moonlighting,&rdquo; Benton had quipped without preamble. &ldquo;Careful, kid. Someone’s bound to notice.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don’t know what you’re talking about,&rdquo; Gideon had replied, doing his best to appear unfazed. It didn’t work. Benton wasn’t the type to bluff—he was a professional shark swimming circles around his prey.</p><p>&ldquo;You’re lucky I’m not interested in blowing whistles,&rdquo; Benton had continued. &ldquo;I’ve got bigger plans in mind. You’ll want to listen closely.&rdquo;</p><p>Gideon had listened, but regret followed him like an unwelcome shadow ever since.</p><hr><p>Detective Marks cleared her throat, yanking Gideon back into the present. &ldquo;Funny how everyone tells me you’re thorough,&rdquo; she remarked, tapping her pen against her notebook as though counting stress beats in a symphony. &ldquo;Yet there&rsquo;s no record of the shipment being signed out under your credentials. Quantum&rsquo;s internal system logs everything. Do you want to explain that discrepancy?&rdquo;</p><p>Gideon straightened in his seat, forcing himself to meet her gaze. &ldquo;I told you, Detective, I acted on orders. Sometimes we don’t use the official logs when we’re fast-tracking certain packages. It saves time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right.&rdquo; Evelyn arched her brow but didn’t dismiss his explanation. Instead, she leaned closer, her presence thick and suffocating, like smoke trapped in a room with no exit. &ldquo;Can I ask the burning question now?&rdquo;</p><p>He didn’t reply, but her pause was intentional, a tool to magnify his discomfort. When she spoke again, her words were razor-sharp.</p><p>&ldquo;How much did you make?&rdquo;</p><p>There it was—the question he’d dreaded. Evelyn Marks wasn’t just following breadcrumbs anymore; she’d arrived at the loaf. What remained was grinding the truth out of his feeble attempts at containment.</p><p>&ldquo;I don’t know what you&rsquo;re talking about,&rdquo; Gideon lied, though his trembling hand revealed what he couldn’t disguise.</p><p>Evelyn exhaled through her nose and shut her notebook with an audible snap. &ldquo;Okay, Mr. Black, listen carefully. I don’t need your confession, though it’d make my job easier. I already know your connections to Benton Reese. I know about the double-cross and the missing shipment. What I need to understand is why you thought working both sides of this fiasco wouldn’t end with you&mldr; well, cornered.&rdquo;</p><p>Suddenly, it wasn’t the dying hum of fluorescent lights Gideon heard but the faint echo of Benton’s voice from months earlier. That fateful meeting came rushing back, faster than Gideon could fend off the memories.</p><hr><p>Benton had outlined a scheme so lucrative it drowned out every ounce of good sense Gideon might’ve mustered. A shipment of &ldquo;XRT pharmaceutical prototypes,&rdquo; as Benton had described them, was passing through Quantum Transit en route to a medical firm in upstate New York. Their worth wasn’t in patents or mass-market profit—it was in exclusivity. Whoever smuggled them first could transform buyers desperate for cutting-edge treatments into billion-dollar investors.</p><p>Benton had swooped in with the proposition: reroute the shipment after falsely logging its delivery, split the profits with Benton’s associates, and reap rewards under Quantum’s oblivious nose.</p><p>&ldquo;But why share with me?&rdquo; Gideon had asked. Benton grinned, his predatory gleam sharpening. &ldquo;Because you’re already dirty, kid, and dirty people don’t say no. I’m giving you the chance to get richer, but only if you play smart.&rdquo;</p><p>Playing smart—that had been the condition, but Gideon had chosen greed instead. He went behind Benton’s back, slicing the operation and pocketing his own profit margin. What choice did he have? Working for Quantum barely kept him above water, and Benton’s cut wasn’t enough for someone risking everything.</p><hr><p>Gideon’s pulse quickened under Evelyn’s unrelenting gaze. She pulled out a folder, flipping past photos, documents, and statements. Each piece of evidence chipped away at his resolve.</p><p>&ldquo;The problem with your plan,&rdquo; Evelyn said, her voice dry as sandpaper, &ldquo;is that you didn’t cover your tracks. Benton knew what you did, and now you can bet he’s eager to finish you off.&rdquo; She closed the folder slowly, as though savoring his panic. &ldquo;Double-crossing a fixer isn’t just reckless—it’s suicidal. Everyone in this town knows that. Except, it seems, you.&rdquo;</p><p>Gideon looked away, his mind spiraling as Evelyn stood from her chair. &ldquo;You’ll want to think carefully about your next words, Mr. Black,&rdquo; she said, sliding the folder into her bag. &ldquo;Because Benton&rsquo;s not the only one who&rsquo;s waiting for answers.&rdquo;</p><p>Before Gideon could plead, question, or crack under the pressure, she exited the office, leaving him with nothing but the dying hum of those cursed lights—and the price of his choices hanging heavily in the air.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/betrayal-and-revenge/>Betrayal and Revenge</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-poisoned-promise/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Poisoned Promise</span>
