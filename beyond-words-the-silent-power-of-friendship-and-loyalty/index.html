At dawn, thin mist hung low above the canal, wisps curling along the towpath where children once raced faded bicycles, laughter blurring with the cry of gulls.</p><p>Joey McCrae arrived at the lock long before the others. He sat on the old iron mooring post, scuffed boots swinging above the water. With a fisherman’s patience, he watched ripples pattern over the surface, his thoughts as placid and slow as the barges gliding by.</p><p>It was never spoken about, but Joey and Samir had claimed this stretch of water as theirs the year they both turned twelve.</p><p>They’d found each other through accidents—Samir’s football had shattered Joey’s mum’s favorite plant pot. Apologies came clumsy, muffled by the differences in their accents. The silence that followed wasn’t awkward. It was the kind you could settle into, like a well-worn hammock.</p><p>Joey waited that morning, running his thumb over the names scratched into the post. He wasn’t lonely—waiting for Samir was its own company. The air changed before the footsteps came, and then there was Samir, hands buried in his jacket, hair full of leaves. He didn’t say a word. He stepped alongside, leaned his back against the same post, and exhaled.</p><p>They didn’t talk about what was wrong. They rarely did. Their comfort was wordless—Samir’s shoulder bumping Joey’s when he saw him blinking too fast, or Joey slipping a crumpled note into Samir’s math book when he was dreading the school bus.</p><p>This friendship wasn’t flashy. It didn’t parade itself in grand gestures or echo through group chats brimming with memes. Its whole power was in its quiet.</p><p>By afternoon, their routine shifted from waiting to wandering, sneakers scuffing faded yellow leaves along the canal. Sometimes, Joey would bring a chess set, the pieces wrapped in a plastic bag to keep dry. Samir barely knew the rules, but he’d learned them for Joey. The games were slow, played out over weeks—a pawn left under a stone, the board scribbled on a scrap of cardboard. Each match was an excuse to keep meeting.</p><p>Other kids from school might have found it odd—these two, one tall and quiet, the other all restless energy, never saying much but always together. But standing side by side, their differences faded. Joey’s silence steadied Samir’s storms; Samir’s gestures stitched life into Joey’s hush. Their loyalty wasn’t broadcasted. It proved itself in moments like when Samir quietly made sure Joey didn’t have to walk home alone if his dad’s shouting could be heard across the flats, or when Joey, with gentle insistence, would drag Samir on long walks whenever his moods grew dark and tight.</p><p>A friendship like this was a shield. When the world pressed in—parents arguing, teachers disappointed, the sudden stings of cruel rumors at school—the lock, the chessboard, the silent walk home became fortresses.</p><p>One January, the canal froze so hard that the ice looked green. Samir arrived one morning with purple bruises shadowing his cheek, his words locked behind clenched teeth. Joey didn’t push questions on him. Instead, he sat by the water’s edge, breaking bits of ice off the edge, tossing them in arcs that shimmered in the pale sun. Samir watched, then joined, each splintering sound a way of saying, I’m here.</p><p>Joey’s own secret wasn’t bruises but disappointment—a father whose promises, always excitedly made, rarely stood up to reality. It was Samir who stood waiting at Joey’s gate at every disappointment, silent but dependable as a heartbeat. They didn’t speak about hurt. They walked it off, left it in the fog that lingered over the canal in early spring.</p><p>Days blended; seasons came and went in a rustle of leaves, shivers of ice, and darting summer swallows. They grew together—taller, warier, quieter in some ways, bolder in others. Exams crowded their minds, futures dangled in the distance. Yet, dusk always found them back at the lock, marking time with chess pieces. Not every story needs conversation; sometimes, all it takes is presence—a shadow beside you in the waning light, a hand steady on your shoulder.</p><p>The power of their friendship ran threadlike—sometimes invisible, never fragile. It carried them through scraped knees and heartbreak, parental quarrels, and the certainty that childhood didn’t last forever.</p><p>The real test came when Samir’s family was told they had to move—another city, another country. The news came to Joey in a silent, flustered handover: a trembling pawn piece, pressed deep into Joey’s palm.</p><p>There are no good words when the world tugs a friend away. Joey, for once, tried. He chose his words carefully. “Will I see you again?” he asked under the willow’s shadow, fighting the wobble in his voice.</p><p>Samir shrugged, eyes bright. “I don’t know.”</p><p>What else was there? They weren’t boys who made big speeches. Instead, they did what they always did—they walked, tossing pebbles into the water, counting the ripples, measuring the space between one heartbeat and the next.</p><p>Samir left before sunrise, a chessboard left on the post for Joey to find. Joey knew what it meant—an unfinished game. Not an end, just a pause.</p><p>He returned to the lock over and over, sometimes not for months. The canal never changed, not really—not the willow curving over the water, not the faded iron of the post. Some days, when the mist was thick and the world muted, Joey would close his eyes and feel it—a presence, steady as ever, walking at his side.</p><p>He would never call Samir’s number, never send awkward, labored messages. There was no need. Their friendship had never needed more than presence. Words had always been optional.</p><p>Years later, Joey found himself walking the towpath with his own child, telling her about the time the canal froze so hard you could walk on it, about the unfinished chess match, the friend whose name was more comfortable in the heart than on the tongue.</p><p>She asked if Samir ever came back.</p><p>Joey smiled at that—at the certainty of it, somehow. “He never left,” he said.</p><p>He could feel it, in the silence and the shared gaze over cold water: a loyalty so steadfast, so quietly unbreakable, that time or distance couldn’t smother it. A power beyond what words could ever reach—anchoring him, steady as always, in the rustle of autumn leaves and the hush of friendship pulled through years like gold through water.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/friendship-and-loyalty/>Friendship and Loyalty</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/beyond-the-velvet-curtain-encounters-of-enduring-brotherhood/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Beyond the Velvet Curtain: Encounters of Enduring Brotherhood</span>
