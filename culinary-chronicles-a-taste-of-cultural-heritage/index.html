Southern cuisine, known for its rich flavors and spices, had a long history that was influenced by the diverse ethnic groups that migrated to the southern states of America. The school, nestled between the Catholic cathedral and the historic French Market, was a community hub where culinary enthusiasts from different walks of life came to share and learn about the art of Southern cuisine.
Classes were conducted in a warmly decorated kitchen where the aroma of Creole spices and freshly baked bread wafted through the air. Chef Samuel, the founder and instructor, welcomed students warmly and led them through his vast knowledge of Southern cuisine, which was a reflection of the early colonial period when European, African, and Caribbean cuisines combined to create a unique flavor profile.
"Our Southern cuisine has roots from our enslaved ancestors who brought ingredients and cooking techniques from their native lands," Chef Samuel explained as he carefully chopped a variety of herbs and vegetables to be used in the day's classes. "Black sugar cane, raw peanuts, okra, and meyer lemons were brought by enslaved Africans while the Spanish, French, and British traders brought bananas, eggplant, and cauliflower, respectively."
In one corner of the kitchen, Maria Santiago whipped up a hearty gumbo filled with catfish, striped scallops, and mushrooms, expertly seasoned with homemade Tony Chachere's seasoned blend.
