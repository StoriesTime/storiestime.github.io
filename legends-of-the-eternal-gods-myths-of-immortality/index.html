From this nothingness, the Eternal Gods arose, self-formed, infinite, and unknowable. They were not born of time or space; they created both and ruled over the cosmos with power beyond mortal comprehension. Among these celestial beings, the concept of immortality was not a prize—it was a truth, a constant that defined their very existence.</p><p>This is their story, one of divine ambition, betrayal, and the fragile balance between eternity and destruction.</p><hr><h3 id=the-forging-of-mortalis><strong>The Forging of Mortalis</strong></h3><p>Aeons before humanity&rsquo;s first whispered prayers, there existed no planets, no living beings, only the formless chaos spinning in an endless sea of potential. Akreon, God of Creation, tireless and inventive, took it upon himself to bring order to the void. Wielding his hammer, Vulnera, forged from the core of the first collapsed star, he shaped Mortalis, the World-Seed, a nexus point from which life itself could emerge.</p><p>Mortalis shimmered in his grasp, small but brimming with infinite possibility. Fire roared from its molten core, while rivers of divine energy coiled around its crust like veins pumping the lifeblood of creation. From this seed, Akreon envisioned a universe alive with countless worlds, each brimming with the echoes of his eternal dreams.</p><p>Yet, to spark life within Mortalis, Akreon knew he would need the Flame of Existence, a sacred fire kept within the heart of Celestiora—the Eternal City of the Gods. This fire, however, was guarded zealously by Nytheria, Goddess of Balance, who viewed Akreon&rsquo;s ambitions with suspicion.</p><p>&ldquo;You seek to play with forces you barely understand,&rdquo; Nytheria warned as Akreon approached. Her voice was like the hum of distant stars, calm and resonant. &ldquo;The Flame of Existence is no mere tool; it is the cornerstone of the divine order. If you misuse it, you risk tearing apart all that we are.&rdquo;</p><p>Akreon, undeterred, replied, &ldquo;Without creation, we are stagnant. Immortality’s beauty lies in witnessing the birth of the new, the unimagined. What purpose is eternity if it lies barren and still?&rdquo;</p><p>Nytheria’s silver eyes narrowed, but she stepped aside, allowing Akreon to claim the flame, though not without a warning. &ldquo;Your actions will have consequences, brother. Beware the hunger of Life—it always desires more than it should.&rdquo;</p><p>With the Flame of Existence, Akreon ignited Mortalis and breathed life into its essence. Mountains rose, rivers flowed, and skies burned bright with the light of twin suns. From the fertile soil of Mortalis, Akreon sculpted the first mortals, beings crafted in the gods’ image, yet bound to the cycle of life and death. Thus, creation gave birth to time, and time gave birth to mortality.</p><hr><h3 id=the-war-of-aeternum><strong>The War of Aeternum</strong></h3><p>As the eons passed, the other gods watched the world of Mortalis with a mixture of wonder and envy. To see mortals thrive—even fleetingly—filled some with pride, while others sensed the dangerous potential of such existence. Chief among the doubters was Kaelvas, the God of Shadows and Secrets.</p><p>Kaelvas was a deity of contradictions, both envious of Akreon’s creations and yet fascinated by their fragility. &ldquo;They are fleeting stars,&rdquo; he once muttered, &ldquo;burning brightly for but a moment. Yet they crave what belongs to us—eternal life. They gaze at the heavens not with gratitude, but with hunger.&rdquo;</p><p>Over time, Kaelvas began to sow discord among the divine pantheon, whispering tales of rebellion. &ldquo;The mortals grow in strength,&rdquo; he claimed. &ldquo;Akreon has given them too much. Even now, they craft weapons to pierce the heavens. They aspire to drink from our chalice of eternity.&rdquo;</p><p>Despite Kaelvas’s growing influence, Akreon remained steadfast in his faith in Mortalis. He believed that the fleeting nature of mortal lives gave their existence meaning, a depth of emotion and experience that even the Eternal Gods could not fathom. But Kaelvas’s suspicions were not entirely unfounded; among the mortals arose a coven of powerful sorcerers who dared to breach the boundary between the divine and the mortal. Led by an enigmatic figure known only as Iltharion, these mortals discovered a way to channel the lingering fragments of godly power that Akreon had woven into existence.</p><p>Mortals began to defy death.</p><p>Iltharion and his followers waged war against the concept of mortality itself, declaring themselves as the Ascended, a new pantheon destined to replace the Eternal Gods. Their ambitions tore through the fabric of reality, threatening the fragile balance that Nytheria had struggled to preserve.</p><p>It was Kaelvas who struck the first blow, his dark legions raining havoc upon Mortalis under the guise of preemptive defense. Yet Akreon, despite his reluctance, took up Vulnera once more and descended to Mortalis to protect the spark of life he had created. The world-altar of Mortalis became a battlefield where gods and mortals alike clashed, their powers shaking the cosmos with every strike.</p><hr><h3 id=the-shattered-pantheon><strong>The Shattered Pantheon</strong></h3><p>The conflict, later known as the War of Aeternum, stretched for centuries. Entire continents on Mortalis crumbled; seas evaporated, replaced by barren deserts where nothing could dwell. Akreon and Kaelvas confronted one another at the Peak of Eternis, the tallest mountain in Mortalis, as the flames of existence burned turbulent across the heavens.</p><p>&ldquo;You’ve doomed us all with your arrogance,&rdquo; Akreon growled, his hammer blazing with raw creation energy. &ldquo;All I sought was life!&rdquo;</p><p>Kaelvas sneered. &ldquo;And now you shall see life in its truest form. Greed, ambition, hunger—these are the fruits of your labor, brother. Do you not see how even immortality bends under such weight?&rdquo;</p><p>Their battle ended as catastrophically as Nytheria had foreseen. With a desperate strike, Akreon shattered Kaelvas’s sword, Nightbane, but in doing so released all the dark energy it held. The shockwave tore the mountain asunder and split the heavens, creating the Rift, a wound in existence that threatens to swallow all creation into the Dark from which the gods were born.</p><p>Nytheria, unable to bear further destruction, intervened, binding Akreon, Kaelvas, and the Ascended in unbreakable chains forged from the remnants of Mortalis itself. She scattered the keys to their prisons across the cosmos, hidden within the stars. Reeling from their hubris, the remaining gods withdrew into Celestiora, vowing never again to interfere with the affairs of mortals.</p><hr><h3 id=legends-of-the-eternal-gods><strong>Legends of the Eternal Gods</strong></h3><p>Today, Mortalis thrives once more, though scars from the War of Aeternum remain in its deepest deserts and forgotten ruins. Mortals, in their ambiguous wisdom, tell tales of the Eternal Gods as both protectors and destroyers, beings who gave life but with it, brought suffering.</p><p>Yet, whispered among the daring and the condemned are rumors of the Rift’s growing hunger. Some claim to see Kaelvas’s shadow slipping through the cracks of reality, while others dream of Akreon’s hammer falling once more. Across time, mortals have found fragments of the divine keys, etched with celestial runes.</p><p>And so the stories persist, myths woven into the fabric of stars and destinies. Every spark of ambition, every mortal hunger for eternity, ensures that the gods’ legacy lives on—an eternal cycle of creation, destruction, and rebirth.</p><p>For immortality, it seems, is not merely the absence of death. It is the weight of forever. And even the gods must bear it.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/mythology-and-legends/>Mythology and Legends</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/legends-of-the-celestial-realms/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Legends of the Celestial Realms</span>
