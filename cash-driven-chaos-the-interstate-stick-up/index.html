I, Jack Steele, a seasoned driver of these pavement roads, had been in this situation more times than I could count, but every time it felt like the first.</p><p>Melded in my black leather jacket, the cool breeze did nothing but disguise the fire that raged inside my heart. The flames of desperation, the warmth of greed. Oh yes, I was on a mission. No turnaround now. My motorcycle roared with anticipation as I pressed down hard on the throttle.</p><p>Texas had always been the perfect ground for heists like these, especially with perfect stretches of interstates occasionally offering serenity, but today something different was needed. We all needed it. Fleetwood Collins, my partner in crime since we were teenagers, needed the score. My friend needed a way out, in a way only money could provide; escape from the chaotic life we&rsquo;d woven.</p><p>&ldquo;The world comes to a finer point in moments like these,&rdquo; I whispered to myself.</p><hr><p>AS I PUT ON MY goggles and helmet, I couldn&rsquo;t help but feel awash in memories of our last caperâ€”the heist that didn&rsquo;t quiet the hunger within. Fleetwood kept his face turned away, lost in thoughts of his own.</p><p>Gathering up my focus, I revved the engine, the rumbling vibration permeating my body, as if it were coaxing my soul awake. The odometer swirled past the triple digits, as the past gave way to the promise of the future.</p><p><strong>I. The Informant</strong></p><p>Before we could chase the money, we had to find it. We had scouted locations for months, an interminable tug-of-war between need and fear. By now, the entire state was aware of the mystery manaces haunting its highways, but I prided myself in getting lucky every once in a while.</p><p>The snitch was a scrawny fellow in a seedy bar near the outskirts of a small town, leaning heavily against the wall. He had told us of a shipment leaving Houston to New Orleans via I-10, loaded with silver and gold. A find worthy of the pursuit it involved.</p><p>Fleetwood gingerly placed his hand on my shoulder. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be our most profitable heist, brother. We&rsquo;re going to get out of this life, once and for all.&rdquo;</p><p>I nodded, but chills shivering down my spine kept me from believing the words we both desperately sought.</p><hr><p>THE TWILIGHT CAST a hazy pall over I-10, an eerie mix of light and shadow as our bikes laid track across the asphalt. An abandoned truck stop broke the monotony of the miles behind us. The fading lights, the rusting metal, all told a story - an unfinished one.</p><p>Before us lay the calm stretch of darkness we needed to dodge. The perfect squeeze between an armada of loaded trucks, their headlights casting twin beams onto the road ahead.</p><p>&ldquo;The location seems to be the perfect spot for a whole slew of legitimately boring, hence forgettable, stakes,&rdquo; Fleetwood mused aloud.</p><p>I was nodding, but my focus remained shot through with tension. We were seeking out chaos, after all. It was in that very wavering calm that I knew our plan would falter.</p><hr><p><strong>II. The Giveaway</strong></p><p>With the world compressed into this singular, fateful moment, all we had to do was execute flawlessly. Now and then, I stole glances at Fort Point, looming in the distance - a sinister sentinel watching over the convoy. The truck tires crunched against gravel, a sound that threatened to betray us if we lingered for even the briefest second.</p><p>We took positions in the midst of the semi-trucks, weaving between idling vehicles as our breaths mingled in the humid, sluggish air.</p><p>Above the low rumble of the engines, Fleetwood&rsquo;s voice crackled over the radio. &ldquo;Get ready, brother.&rdquo;</p><p>I leaned over to my bike, yanking my gloves off one handed and producing a revolver, a silver muzzle glinting wickedly in the light. An ethos drawn from the early days of banditry.</p><p>As the pickup caravan surged forward, drivers oblivious to the danger, my heart gave a thundering protest. &ldquo;Cash-driven chaos,&rdquo; I thought. &ldquo;The ultimate rollercoaster.&rdquo;</p><p>Then, without warning, we struck. With our guns drawn and voices raised - &ldquo;Keep driving!&rdquo; - we ordered any individuals who dared a glance.</p><p>Fear-fed silence spilled through the trucks&rsquo; interstellar shadows, and a sudden chill seized my soul.</p><hr><p>IAN INSTANT, IT became apparent our target vehicle was carrying something altogether more volatile than our original intel. A Julep Chemicals tanker barreled through the brake-checking convoy, the robed drivers reeling as if from a hot sun.</p><p>&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s wrong!&rdquo; Fleetwood choked, his voice garbled in horror.</p><p>The gurgling siren wail of the tanker and a barrage of bullets stirred the predictable pandemonium.</p><p>The tanker came to a screeching halt, I could see its driver slumped over the wheel. Flames licked at the road.</p><p>&ldquo;And they say there&rsquo;s no profit in chaos,&rdquo; I whispered.</p><hr><p>A MOUND OF shattered glass and twisted metal, the tanker bore witness to the scorching flames clawing their way along I-10. The air sizzled, fire dancing along the broken bones of the highway. Somewhere amidst the screams and the chaos, the shooting and the smoke, I caught sight of a suitcase borne aloft on the relentless firestorm, then vanishing amidst the smoke.</p><p>My breath caught in my throat. Our getaway route crumbled before our eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Fleetwood,&rdquo; I barked, &ldquo;We are going down.&rdquo;</p><p>And yet, we fought. And then - swiftly, efficiently - we fled.</p><hr><p><strong>III. The Fallout</strong></p><p>Weeks later, hunkered in a small cabin in the highlands of New Mexico, a weary and resourceful Fleetwood and I sorted our losses from our gains. Truth be told, the &lsquo;win&rsquo; was small considering our losses.</p><p>There were no winners in our tale, only scars threading the highways like fractures in time.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s time to look elsewhere for what we need,&rdquo; I said quietly as the nothing of the New Mexico night clawed in around us.</p><p>Fleetwood blinked, his eyes carrying a resignation I could scarcely bare. But there will always be highways crisscrossing this country; lonely highways weaving between hope and dread.</p><p>Maybe this was just one of those times.</p><p>The end.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/robbery-and-heists/>Robbery and Heists</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/car-chase-confessions-escaping-the-ultimate-heist/><span class=title>Â« Prev</span><br><span>Car Chase Confessions: Escaping the Ultimate Heist</span>
