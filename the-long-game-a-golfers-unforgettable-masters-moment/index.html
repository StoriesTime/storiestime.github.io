The soft whisper of the ball, when Landon unleashed it into the hazy air, was barely audible. It sailed through the cloudy atmosphere and disappeared into the awestruck beauty that was the 16th hole - poetically, the half-way point in the storied Masters Tournament. In that single, spiritually unforgettable moment, the entire world seemed to pause, captive to the air’s delicate embrace of Landon&rsquo;s incredible shot.</p><p>Landon, a small-town embedded lawyer from the wood-panelled, personal-touch era by the name of Greenburg, knew he had stolen a piece of history. Yet, the magnitude of this incredible moment bore down upon him like an olympian&rsquo;s steed. He pulled his cap brim, a rough and distressed vintage textAlign he always wore, low over his eyes, and tried to remember to breathe. His fingers trembled and his mind raced as he replayed the seconds preceding the shot. His coach had warned, &ldquo;Landon, take deep breaths, visualize the path, and trust the club.&rdquo; And he had.</p><p>Everyone around him choked on their coffee and clapped in syncopated gasps, helplessly craning their necks as they watched his ball dance high, high, higher still, before it finally dipped into the vortex of wind and gravity, plummeting towards the infamous green.</p><p>With each heartbeat of anticipation, it felt to Landon like the seconds of his life were arriving in slow motion before speeding up. As the ball landed softly with a whisper, on the ridge above the green&mldr; Landon heard it. The hee-haw of the goats that lived on the mountainside beyond the green. It sounded funny, incongruent, yet simultaneously it felt like the most in-sync event of his life.</p><p>The satisfaction rendered Landon breathless. It was no longer a game he played. It was life&rsquo;s greatest symphony. The euphoric realization hit him stronger than the adrenaline, &ldquo;I am performing at the highest level of my abilities, on the world’s biggest stage&rdquo;.</p><p>The commentator, dripping enthrallment in every sentence, gathered himself to inform millions of viewers, &ldquo;And there you have it, ladies and gentlemen – an incredible feat. Just look at Landon Westmere, standing tall and proud amongst his peers.&rdquo;</p><p>His family and friends, gathered from across the states, wearing hats of varying degrees of decadence and Landon Westmere Baseball Caps, erupted in cheers. A few squeezed their eyes shut, as if afraid that opening them would mean the impossible had indeed been a dream.</p><p>Landon Westmere was no stranger to the grand stage. Chroniclers the world over would know that he spent his formative years quietly dominating amateur golf championships. The whirlwind of attention that followed quelled his early ambition, and he took up law instead. Some said he could&rsquo;ve been a professional golfer had he pursued it. But no man is a prophet in his own land, it was said.</p><p>That was before he was Christened &ldquo;The Long Game&rdquo;. A moniker bestowed by sports magazine editors, impressed by Landon&rsquo;s uncanny ability to concoct impossible shots from seemingly unpromising positions. But now, on the hallowed greens of Augusta, it struck him just how befitting the nickname was.</p><p>In the interest of tradition, etiquette, and professionalism, Landon maintained decorum and did not allow himself to visibly deflate now that the ball lay mere feet away from its intended target. But an expert eye could see the subtle coiling of his muscles, betraying his eagerness to see if his efforts would be sufficient.</p><p>There it lay, &lsquo;The Long Game&rsquo;, the ball Landon had conjured from the heavens, nestled just beside the hole. It seemed almost reluctant to be so near, as if it had lived its comparatively short existence just to place itself in this suspended moment of truth.</p><p>Before the world erupted into extended applause and news analytics, before his family leapt from their seats and complained of heart palpitations, Landon Westmere experienced the calm after a storm. His hands, still gripping the club, sweat and grass caked onto the textured leather, began to unclench. His eyes held onto their prize – the ball perched inches from the green – and honestly as he could, Landon allowed himself to experience not victory or pride, but gratitude for this unexpected gift of time and place.</p><p>As the sunlight struggled through the dissipating mist, Landon began the walk to the green, absently wiping the back of his hand across his lips, having unconsciously left a streak of earth upon them. He walked deliberately, through a valley of doubt and over mountains of fear, to claim his moment in the sun.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/sports-and-competitions/>Sports and Competitions</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-last-shot-how-one-moment-defined-a-career/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Last Shot: How One Moment Defined a Career</span>
