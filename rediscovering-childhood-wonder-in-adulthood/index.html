The city’s dusk filtered through the high window, splashing stripes across his stack of unopened mail. Somewhere beneath bills and flyers squatted a birthday card from his mother, unopened. Forty today. A round number, which—according to everything from sitcoms to self-help podcasts—should prompt reflection, celebration, discomfort, or at least, Dorian supposed, something more than what he felt right now: a drowsy, gray, regular ache.</p><p>He set his briefcase on the kitchen table. The contracts inside waited, patient as stones. He poured himself a glass of water, studied his own dim reflection in the oven’s chrome. The memories of childhood, when they came, arrived as flickers: swinging through air that smelled of cut grass, watching paper lanterns float in a creek at dusk, listening for the hollow whistle of a distant train in the blue hours of summer.</p><p>That seemed to belong to someone else.</p><p>He scrolled his phone idly, eyes skating over headlines, mouth twitching at memes, thumbing past a coworker’s birthday post—sliced cake in a Tupperware, a single candle, ironic optimism in the caption. Dorian set his phone down. He could not find a reason to care. The silence in the room pressed around him like cellophane.</p><p>Shouldn’t birthdays matter more?</p><p>He remembered the year he turned eight: his father, beaming, led him after supper to the backyard where dozens of lanterns hung from tree branches, bobbing in the humid breeze. Each one was painted with scenes from local legends. For a moment, Dorian had mistaken them for fireflies, so enchanted was he by their glow.</p><p>He blinked, squeezing that memory like a sponge. The feeling of excitement, the anticipation, was sharp as tacks even after all these years. He almost smiled.</p><p>Standing abruptly, Dorian slipped on his jacket and stepped into the evening. He walked out past the polite shrubs of his apartment complex, past low stoops where neighbors smoked and argued and laughed, all the way toward the old city park.</p><p>The sky was quilted thick with cloud, but dusk still leaked through in gold and brass. As he walked, the streetlights flickered to life in hesitant succession. His feet found the rhythm of childhood: summer sandals, dirt paths beneath tall trees, the creak of swings, chalk dragons smudged on pavement by thunderstorm rain.</p><p>When Dorian reached the park, he was surprised to find people he didn’t recognize stringing up lanterns between the maple trees. There was laughter, barking dogs, a band setting up on the small stone bandstand. Children zipped through the grass, trailing streamer ribbons and chasing each other relentlessly. Near the duck pond, a group was folding sheets of colored paper.</p><p>As he lingered at the edge of the light, he felt awkward, like a guest at a party for which he’d lost his invitation. Still, the air was warm and alive with music and wood smoke from a distant grill. He clutched his jacket tight about his chest.</p><p>A woman approached him, smiling as if she knew him, and offered a lantern of blue paper and wire, with a simple string handle. “Want to help us finish the row?” she asked, the words casual, easy.</p><p>Caught, Dorian hesitated, but took the lantern. Its paper was softer than he expected, the blue a color that looked almost edible.</p><p>“Over there.” She gestured at the next tree. “It’s flimsy. Don’t let it tear.”</p><p>Clumsily, Dorian tied the thin cord to the branch she indicated, stepping through the grass and avoiding a boy of about seven who was pretending to be a tiger. Something about the boy’s ferocity made Dorian smile—he remembered being that tiger once; remembered running with fierce, ridiculous abandon, uncaring how the world watched him.</p><p>The lantern swayed. He stepped back, admiring the patchwork of light growing overhead, paper and flame scattered like constellations in the trees. The band struck a chord, and the familiar tingle from boyhood sleepovers came prickling up his arms.</p><p>Someone handed him a sandwich, unsolicited, and Dorian accepted it gratefully. Muffled jazz floated through the grass. Children shrieked, sprinted past, headed for the footbridge over the creek. He stuffed his hands in his pockets, chewed, watched the moving patterns.</p><p>There was a little girl, maybe five, who tugged at the hem of his jacket. “Are you going to let yours go?” she asked.</p><p>He shook his head. “I think it’s meant to stay,” he replied, nodding at the branches lined with bobbing blue lanterns.</p><p>“Oh.” She shrugged and darted back to her game.</p><p>Dorian followed her toward the water. On the bridge stood a group of older children with folding canoes of newspaper and foil, launching them into the silver-black currents. The moon, a chipped coin behind the clouds, scuffed the creek’s surface.</p><p>He watched, and found himself recalling the myth his father told him the night of the backyard lanterns: each glowing orb carried wishes, or worries, up to some listening spirit among the oak trees.</p><p>Dorian folded his arms against the dusk. What would he wish, now? His mind fumbled over professional successes—closing accounts, ticking boxes, collecting plaid shirts hung in a row, clean and precise, nobody ever spilling juice on the floor.</p><p>How desperately, now, he wanted to spill something. To taste the magic in the mess.</p><p>A woman, her hair streaked with silver, sat on the edge of the bridge. She patted the space beside her.</p><p>“It’s beautiful,” Dorian said as he joined her.</p><p>She nodded. “We started it for the kids, years ago. But you know, the lanterns aren’t for them. They already believe. It’s for the rest of us.”</p><p>He glanced at her, surprised.</p><p>She grinned, eyes crinkling. “When you’re grown, it’s easy to forget how to wonder. But sometimes a lantern’s enough to light the way back. Just a little. Even if you’re not looking for it.”</p><p>Dorian remembered the newspaper boat, the dragons in chalk, the unsolved riddle of fireflies. He watched a boy leap onto a shopping cart, roaring as his father chased him, laughing.</p><p>He felt the ache inside him soften—just a little.</p><p>Would it last past tomorrow? Maybe not. He could feel the gravity of his life waiting, meetings and reports and apartments scrubbed of story.</p><p>But for now, with paper lanterns glowing and laughter skimming across the water, Dorian let himself wonder: what if he brought this magic with him, even just a little, into the neon-lit mornings and silent commutes? Would it make the gray shine? Would something bloom in the cracks he’d collected?</p><p>He stood up, thanking the woman, and wandered along the bank until he found a slip of paper and a stub of pencil. He wrote a wish—clumsy, open, tentative. He tucked it into a lantern and set it afloat with the others. He watched his own hope drifting, unhurried and luminous, out onto the gentle water.</p><p>The city’s hum faded into birdsong and wild banter. Dorian stood in the cool, lantern-lit dark, and for the first time in years he felt small, and yet immeasurably alive. The world, suddenly, was wide and possible once again, edged in silver and burning softly with an old, familiar wonder he’d almost forgotten he could feel.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/childhood-and-adolescence/>Childhood and Adolescence</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/real-life-childhood-and-adolescent-stories/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Real-Life Childhood and Adolescent Stories</span>
