Cities, nearly emptied, pulsed in erratic rhythms; holographic news feeds screamed evacuation instructions in all languages, looping over jittery, borrowed images of the launch pads. No one slept. If they did, dreams carried them to places where air still tasted like rain, and the horizon didn’t end in ash.</p><p>Kiah Renholt’s hands shook even before her fingers curled around the forged transit pass. Outside the waiting room’s grimy plex, the sky above Antananarivo blazed, mottled with chemical haze and the red-and-gold trails of shuttle exhaust. The whispers around her sometimes snapped into angry bites, sometimes just faded out. “Six ships left,” someone muttered behind her, voice hoarse from the dust.</p><p>Six ships. Twelve meant to launch; six were lost before the skies could even clear.</p><p>She stared up at the countdown, relayed by satellites still limping along in low orbit. <strong>16 hours, 42 minutes.</strong> Kiah gripped her satchel even tighter as she shuffled forward. Everything she owned, or had ever loved, was mashed into one battered canvas bag: family pictures, her grandmother’s broken telescope, a crumpled letter from her brother stationed on Europa, unpaid credit chips, a sachet of soil.</p><p>It was supposed to be different.</p><p><strong>It started in whispers, too:</strong>
<em>Have you heard about the exodus program?</em>
<em>They say there’s only room for a few…the ships are massive. They’re not taking everyone.</em>
<em>A lie—a distraction.</em>
<em>Or salvation.</em></p><p>Kiah’s father had called it the end of all that Earth could offer. “We parasitized the garden, and this is the invoice.” He laughed in the kitchen the day the first selection lists were announced, his laughter tracking into despair. Those selected wore armbands, blue-lit; those not selected wore hollow eyes.</p><h4 id=the-selection>The Selection</h4><p>Kiah hadn’t made the first lists. Or the second. But she&rsquo;d been quick, and desperate, and lucky—if you counted luck as crawling through ten thousand web forums to find an underground network of engineers and ex-astronauts forging identities for the highest bidder. Her forged ID labeled her a mid-level cryogenics tech, a skill the ships sorely needed.</p><p>She wondered if the ships would check very closely. Only the desperate and the defiant were left at this point. The elite had long since gone—in September, slipping quietly into orbit one evening while the world burned wild with rumors and rage.</p><p>Now, at the checkpoint, guards in battered UN jackets scanned passes and retinas. Every few minutes, a shriek; every few, a gate pass spat out with a red warning. The unlucky ones didn’t come back through the line. Kiah tried not to track them.</p><p>Her turn. The scanner stuttered, a little longer than she’d hoped, and the guard watched her with tired, knowing eyes.</p><p>“Cryo tech, huh?” he murmured, skepticism thick as fog.</p><p>She nodded. “I did long-hauls for Meridia Transport. Europa routes, back in ’71.” The lie was smooth—she’d rehearsed it night after night, staring at the cracked ceiling of her apartment, waiting for dawn and for hope to run dry. He hit the override. The gate spat out a thin slip, blue with holographic numbers.</p><p>“Pad eleven. Launch in three hours. Don’t get left behind.”</p><p>She barely remembered walking the kilometer from checkpoint to shuttle pad. Around her marched a procession of the world’s remnants—with their bags, their relics, their prayers.</p><h4 id=the-ship-iss-valkyrie>The Ship: ISS Valkyrie</h4><p>Pad eleven was a cathedral of steel and blue lights, domed over with smoke. The ISS Valkyrie didn’t look like the artist renderings she used to see on deep net message boards: sleek, white arcs and shining domes. In truth, it looked like a battered cruise ship bolted atop a cluster of water tanks and rocket stages, patched with haphazard modules from every spacefaring nation.</p><p>A few engineers in orange suits barked orders at the crowd of arrivals. Drones zipped above, scanning faces, checking pulses. Boarding the ship was a delirious blur: a coding of faces and paperwork, a narrow tunnel shuddering with the vibration of mighty engines already awake.</p><p>Inside, corridors thrummed with energy and the familiar stink of too many people in too small a space. Bunks lined every wall. Kiah found her assigned pod, upper row in Segment 4B. Eight strangers already claimed the corners, eyes wary. She claimed the last mattress, wedging her bag between her knees.</p><p>The announcement came over the intercom: “All crew, all passengers—prepare for immediate launch. Standby for final systems check.”</p><p>Kiah pressed her hand to her temple, feeling the rush of fear and elation and loss—all mashed into a single, burning mass.</p><p>Somewhere, deep in the hull, systems flickered awake. Cryo chambers—real ones—breathed cold mist. Water tanks groaned. Somewhere, digital ghosts checked and re-checked the course to Proxima b, three light-years and a century’s journey away.</p><h4 id=the-launch>The Launch</h4><p>There was no countdown, not for the passengers, not those last ones desperate enough to claim a place on the final ship. There was only a sudden buckling force, the world tilting sharply, bones humming with vibration as engines roared.</p><p>The screens above every module played live feeds: down on the pad, the city burning with light as spectators flooded the roads, backs to the dying world for one last glimpse of those leaving. Fires still burned in the distance, flags fluttered—UN blue, scorched at the edges—while somewhere, a thin-faced reporter tried to sound hopeful, announcing the final escape.</p><p>“Humanity’s last exodus, the Valkyrie, beginning her journey away from Earth—”</p><p>No one in the ship made a sound.</p><p>Outside, the planet shrank rapidly beneath them, a marble smeared by dusk and storms. The atmosphere peeled away. Gravity thinned, rivers of tears and sweat floating freely as the arc of the Earth slipped behind the viewport.</p><p>They were gone.</p><h4 id=the-exodus-routine>The Exodus Routine</h4><p>Long days on board blurred together. The ship cycled through false dawns and artificial nights, lamps shifting from blue to amber. The elders took over what little recreation space remained, leading whispered prayers—sometimes to god, sometimes just to the future. Children’s laughter turned to silence over the weeks, replaced by the drone of fans and the whir of hidden machinery.</p><p>All the passengers agreed on one rule: no one talked about Earth, not after the second week. To speak of home was to unravel.</p><p>Kiah spent her days in the cryogenics bay, pretending to check and recalibrate the chambers while reading hurried manuals filched from the ship database. Those who went under—wealthy, sick, or hopeful—trusted her to keep them alive for the years spanning interstellar travel. She wondered at night if they’d made the right choice, entrusting their eternity to a woman who’d once only known how to hack together a fridge compressor.</p><p>As boredom warred with dread, rumors flared: that one other ship, the ISS Helios, had survived launch and was racing ahead. That there was sabotage in the data banks—a virus seeded by those left behind, a bitter farewell. That Proxima b was a lie, and the real destination was emptiness.</p><h4 id=the-mutiny>The Mutiny</h4><p>In the sixth month, tempers finally snapped. Ration modules failed—three meal days quickly collapsed to two, then one and a half. Arguments over air allocation bruised even the kindest faces. The ship captain—a slim, tight-mouthed woman from Vladivostok called Major Ivana Derevenko—called a meeting, streaming her face into every cabin.</p><p>“We are not animals, nor are we prisoners,” she snapped in five languages. “This vessel is our only hope. Division will ruin us before the void does. Elections for crew representation will begin tonight.”</p><p>It wasn’t enough. Three days later, two hydroponics techs were caught sabotaging the recycler valves, demanding a change of course to Saturn—chasing a rumor of a secret base with supplies. Kiah found herself dragged into impromptu tribunals, forensic kits pressed into her hands. Her technical background—fake as it was—suddenly made her indispensable.</p><p>Try as she might, she could not hate the mutineers. Hope, she realized, was nothing less than a weapon on this ship—cherished, wielded, and, sometimes, lethal.</p><h4 id=the-discovery>The Discovery</h4><p>Year one floated by, measured in missed birthdays, in the growing silence of the ship as more people entered the deep freeze to sleep away decades. Kiah resisted—she preferred the pain of wakefulness to dreams.</p><p>One quiet morning, the ship’s sensors howled: an anomaly dead ahead, a structure not on any chart. Navigation drones zipped to the fore. The screens out in the common room flashed grainy images: a vast derelict—impossible, ancient, tethered to nothing.</p><p>Gravity shifted and snapped as they drew closer. The derelict’s hull was pitted and split along its seams, but on the side nearest the Valkyrie, a battered flag fluttered: red, white, and green hexes—a flag no one recognized. Some argued it was from a rival mission, an artifact of failed earlier launches.</p><p>Onboard drones found only silence; no life, but strange caches of crystalline spores, unique alloys laced through the hull—likely engineered, perhaps even alive.</p><p>Arguments raged for days: salvage the derelict, risking infection or contamination, or pass it by and honor the journey’s sanctity.</p><p>Kiah voted to salvage. Why not? The past was dead—only the future mattered.</p><p>They sent in drones, then small teams in makeshift EVA suits. The data banks—corrupted—hinted at a civilization begun and ended in the black. The spores, sampled and isolated, offered promise for soil regeneration—if they ever reached a world green enough to try. For a while, curiosity brightened the haunted eyes. For a while, the ship remembered joy.</p><h4 id=arrival>Arrival</h4><p>Decades slipped by—ten, then fifty, then more. Most adults passed into the chill cocoon of cryosleep, leaving automated systems and a handful of “rotators” like Kiah to steer and maintain. The children grew, learned, forgot their parents’ faces, spoke new dialects in the echoing halls.</p><p>Kiah awoke from the briefest sleep to an alarm light: <strong>DECELERATE</strong>.</p><p>Proxima b hung ahead, blurred and faint—a pinprick of green amid the endless night. The planet’s surface, visible through the ship’s largest dome, glimmered with ice and possibility.</p><p>They were the first. No distress signals, no messages from lost ships, only the static silence common to interstellar travel. Systems kicked awake. Hydroponics hummed at full capacity, the spores from the derelict transferred and already thriving—greening the recycled trays with shoots that glowed faintly in the dim light. Water condensed on the hull, recycling systems shivered to life.</p><p>Random survivors—descendants, really—crowded the viewports. No one cheered. Weariness had long since replaced celebration.</p><p>They landed the Valkyrie on a shale plateau aboard emergency skiffs—landing only what the ship could spare. The recon teams wandered across fields of black moss, over ice floes riddled with possibilities. Strange, crystal-edged plants swayed in the winds. Gravity felt unfamiliar; it pressed memory from bone.</p><p>Kiah, aged beyond her years, watched as the children collected the alien soil in their hands and pressed seeds into it, ignorant of empires and extinctions. Above, the outline of the Valkyrie hung like a myth—a promise built from loss.</p><p>She kept her promises, even the ones woven from lies and fear.</p><h4 id=epilogue-the-great-space-exodus>Epilogue: The Great Space Exodus</h4><p>Word spread, across flickering radios and long-range comms straining over light years. Refugees from the Valkyrie planted their first crops, assembled new shelters from the ship’s skin and ancient alloys. They sent a beacon—a single word carried on encrypted bands, the old tongue and the new: <strong>Arrived.</strong></p><p>No one answered, not for years.</p><p>Still, they built. Rustling leaves sang beneath a foreign sun. Kiah walked ridgelines at dawn, mud caking her boots, watching a lost fragment of humanity scrape new life from alien earth.</p><p>When she slept, she saw Earth as it once was—before the torment, before the exodus—a blue home preserved in memory, not in reality.</p><p>Kiah smiled in her dreams. A world fled, another found. No such thing as a sanctuary—only the fierce will to begin again.</p><p>Above, the constellations spun, unheeding. The future, like always, waited for the ones bold enough to call it home.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/science-fiction/>Science Fiction</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/escape-from-earth-a-sci-fi-escape-plan/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Escape from Earth: A Sci-Fi Escape Plan</span>
