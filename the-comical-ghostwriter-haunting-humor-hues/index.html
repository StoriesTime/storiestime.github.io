Nevertheless, a peculiar pantomime unfolded amidst the shadows of the forgotten. In a dusty old study, aged manuscripts would inexplicably come to life in their heaps, flinging themselves off shelves only to be captured by a synthetic silhouette. This bizarre behavior had the adepts of English mulling over its cause through their mugs of hearty coffee.</p><p>Little did they know, the Seraphim of Satire and master of absurdist anecdotes had begun to weave his clever competent copy. Somersaulting from silence into the realm of words was none other than&mldr;Ghislain, the Comical Ghostwriter.</p><p>Ghislain had been but a humble human known for his humorous hundred-page single-spaced short stories once upon a past life. Now a spirit, he had wandered for a thousand Vainglorious Vespers and finally stumbled upon this quaint corner. It dawned on him that his gift lay in constructing paragraphs of pure pirouetting punchlines.</p><p>Intrigued by the ink-stained virgins worshipping their kegs of keystrokes, the haunted humorist decided to make some headlines himself. He began by infiltrating an editor&rsquo;s inkwell during a momentary lapse of reality. With a brush of his spectral mustache, Ghislain elucidated the simple yet ingenious cabinetry of the Capers of Candelabra Chaos, thereby grafting hilarious headlines onto the cover of every issue.</p><p>It transpired the inhabitants of this little burg were to fall etiquette purveyors, desperately clinging to the art of proper etiquette. These heinous harbingers of high-society sought guidance from a bejeweled bard by the name of Eleanor, whose bibliophilic bonanza of &ldquo;Blessed Behavior Blessings&rdquo; had begathered the benighted breeds into a bosom of beclouded bewilderment and bondages.</p><p>To Ghislain, it appeared as but the setting for a squall of scriptedtête-à-têtes. With a tilt of his terrycloth turban, he whispered into the minds of several amused satirists, planting the germinates of galvanic guffaws in the form of articles on &ldquo;The Teetotaler&rsquo;s Tea Party&rdquo; and &ldquo;Etiquette for Extraterrestrials: An Outer Space Odyssey&rdquo;.</p><p>The aforementioned editor of his choice, penning graceless and graceless drivel, tumbledupon the very same gibes that those haughty hordes held dear. The steed of satire having taken flight, Ghislain could not resist venturing forth into the newspaper with his indelible ink.</p><p>And lo, the stories of the sweet and sour silhouettes unfurled in tomorrows beyond count, oft calling for camaraderie amongst the cabaret of the cosmos, stroking the stodgy stalwarts of suffering societies till they burst out laughing.</p><p>Thus, soon opinions of proper prose were prophesied and proved. The drollery continued, debated, and doubted over the veiled visions formed from the vapors of Victorian vainglory.</p><p>As the annals of agony and ecstasy soared, etching shadows onto every mindscape, the substandard journalist quaked with quiverings within the quagmire. Searching for comfort with a crumb of commendation, she shattered into silence, unable to fathom her former fearsomeness.</p><p>The illustrious gigs of the inked ignoble incited inner insurrections within their individual intestines. The once venerated voices of virtue became but squalls of scratches upon the canvas, obliterated by the Comical Ghostwriter&rsquo;s incredible incursions.</p><p>Ghislain reveled in his roving recollections, swaying as he gleaned through old galas and glittering gossip. He spurned society&rsquo;s sanitization of satire, seeking solace in a spirited society of secretary, scribe, and specter.</p><p>Such was the subtle serenade of Ghislain, that the newsletter began to thrill with tales of trumpet, toast, and triumph from tendings till twilight. They sought mirth between meetings of malaise and, so, stumbled slowly into the twilight with tales of trumpet, toast, and triumph from tendings till twilight.</p><p>Maintaining his maundering masculine mien, the conjuror of cosmic clout continued to cascade his capers magna cum laude.</p><p>It came to pass that the fair Eleanor, perched upon her pedestal of pompous power, was to address the very assembly for whom Ghislain had infiltrated with his insouciant ironies. The ambassador of bonhomie had the longtime luminary lump in her throat as she addressed its little local leaders.</p><p>&ldquo;Forgive me for laughing,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but you have become the joke, the subjects of our satire. We must indeed be the jesters as penance, we must thus exalt the excellently extravagant era of the Comical Ghostwriter.&rdquo;</p><p>Bearing the burden of bemused benevolence, the enthusiast of euphoric expression Eleanor whispered. Eleanor announced most precipitately, &ldquo;I am but a specter among mediocrities. Let the ink ensnare the unwary detractors of levity&rsquo;s landscape.&rdquo;</p><p>The learned ladies and lords of letters could only look upon her luckless looks. The ravenous revelers of romantic realism no longer reigned. Transformed, these transgressors of truthful taunts and tributes now toiled in the tattered trenches of the tongue-in-cheek terrain.</p><p>Yet, not devoid of their symbiotic search for somber souls with whom they may superficially share the silent stage of society, they nonetheless noticed the spirit peering through the predawn - yet to release his poetic platitudes with perpetual perseverance.</p><p>Now, the comic ghostwriter found no need to covet the corporeal world, for he had taken residence in the realm of ridicule and relaxation as he spun his fantastical fables for future festivities.</p><p>Thus continues the chronicle of the comical Comical Ghostwriter, seated among the sacred halls of randomness and rollickinganecdotes, pauper of phrase but potentate of pathetic pillow proclamations.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/comedy-and-humor/>Comedy and Humor</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-comedy-of-losing-my-phone/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Comedy of Losing My Phone</span>
