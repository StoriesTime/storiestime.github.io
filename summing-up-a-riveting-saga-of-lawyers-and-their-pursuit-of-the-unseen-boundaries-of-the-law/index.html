The building, a historical edifice of limestone and stained glass, was a beacon for litigants and legal eagles alike. Here, among these hallowed halls, the finest attorneys in the land plied their trade.</p><p>Among the ranks of skilled advocates, there was a man, Elroy G. Bream, who stood out. Tall, with a shock of silver-white hair, he commanded the respect of his peers and the awe of his clients. A seasoned lawyer, Bream had honed his craft over decades, amassing a wealth of experiences and a reputation as an attorney par excellence.</p><p>One day, in the hushed quiet of the firm&rsquo;s library, Elroy G. Bream received a letter. It was a summons of sorts, for he was to defend a peculiar case that had all of the firm&rsquo;s members abuzz with anticipation. The case involved a lawsuit against the ethereal, the metaphysical - a lawsuit against an intangible, unseen boundary.</p><p>As the courtroom filled with anticipation, Elroy G. Bream stood before the judge, feeling the weight of responsibility upon his shoulders. The opposing counsel, a portly and brash young man named Clive Huddle, smirked confidently. Behind Bream, his fellow practitioners whispered animatedly about the case&rsquo;s unconventional nature.</p><p>Bream cleared his throat, his scarlet tie whispering against his starched bosom, and began to present his case. He spoke eloquently, marshaling an array of seemingly disjointed points in favor of his client, each shrewdly calculated to chip away at the puffed-up assumptions of the opposition.</p><p>As the trial wore on, Clive Huddle found himself struggling to quell his rising anxiety. His one-sided caricature of the ethereal was crumbling before the deft touch of Elroy Bream&rsquo;s argument. It seemed that Bream was not only rehearsed, but possessed a natural ability to twist the law inexactly into service of the unseen.</p><p>Midafternoon on the third day of testimony, the judge announced a recess. Elroy Bream retreated to the obsidian embrace of a wingback chair, his confidence intact but unassuming.</p><p>Arms folded, he glanced up to find Clive Huddle standing before him, hatless and bracing himself for an intense exchange.</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Bream,&rdquo; Huddle began, his voice betraying a sense of urgency, &ldquo;I believe we both know that this case hinges upon on the intangible&mldr; and I wish to offer you a deal.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is it your contention,&rdquo; Elroy G. Bream asked, his great brow furrowing, &ldquo;that a court of law may not have jurisdiction over the intangible or the ethereal?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Huddle replied, softer now, &ldquo;but let&rsquo;s say I make a generous monetary offer toward the settlement of this suit.&rdquo;</p><p>A silence fell between the two, the air charged as the world seemed to wait and weigh on Bream&rsquo;s every breath as he assessed Huddle&rsquo;s proposition.</p><p>It seemed an eternity had passed—they were bound by this suspended moment, before the judge swept into the room, saturing the air with purpose and a voice booming, &ldquo;This court is now in session.&rdquo;</p><p>The gavel struck its resounding echo, and in that moment Bream made his decision.</p><p>&ldquo;The offer is compelling,&rdquo; he responded, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll consider it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; Huddle said before turning away, &ldquo;for I am certain I could proved the ethereal non-existence.&rdquo;</p><p>Elroy Bream stood, the judge looked to him, and the courtroom held its breath.</p><p>&ldquo;But you won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Bream declared unequivocally, &ldquo;for the unseen cannot be erased.&rdquo;</p><p>Confidently he stepped forward, and delivered his final argument.</p><p>&ldquo;Madam judge, Your Honor, the unseen exists, and we should cherish its existence, not attempt to disprove it.&rdquo;</p><p>The courtroom rose to their feet. A hush descended upon Huddle and his retinue as the judge declared the verdict: the ethereal boundary was upheld.</p><p>For Elroy G. Bream, the victory was a bittersweet one. As he walked back into the firm&rsquo;s grand corridors, he knew that he had only postponed the question of the ethereal&rsquo;s place in the realm of the law.</p><p>Barrington, Bristow & Bailey, a bastion of conservative legal thinking, would have to wake up—if only to admit that the unseen needed no help in proving its existence.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/legal-dramas/>Legal Dramas</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/smokescreens-of-justice-short-legal-thriller-stories/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Smokescreens of Justice: Short Legal Thriller Stories</span>
