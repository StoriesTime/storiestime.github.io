With an infamous pantomime grin-twitch, he rounded the corner on a quaint cobblestone alley toward destiny. Little did he know he was there to change the course of time-as-we-know&ndash;and have some furry creature friends await him there!</p><p>At first, Dimo meandered like an iridescent bubble dancing casually toward the vast blue yonder through streets teeming with peculiar characters&ndash;their bodies, if only like his, being but talented shapes between raw comic anticipation-actors and knee-slappers, enchanting music and dreamy visions swirling in the thin air. They uniformly chuckled over the elusive gateway to adventure.</p><p>A symphony began to bead behind his ears, erupting into an exasperated opera&ndash;Dimo&rsquo;s heart splashed pinnacles into an otherwise simple crescendo, as the night sky opened up, flooded the alleyway, punctuating the thick cotton-candy darkness with stars twirling like disco balls. Yesss, the gateway to the paradox pawsome awaited.</p><p>Dimo braced himself as he approached its spiraling vortex&ndash;entrance to a labyrinthine blend where time and space ceased to be ordered and measured. Even the ground, far from being solid, breathed rhythmically as it changed with each footstep, half-smiling back as if it were an old best friend.</p><p>Entering the vortex, our hero stifled laughter-laden with sarcastic hope-against-hope that everyone was going to fare dandy in the trials to come!</p><p>Before he could step farther into the time-traveling tunnel, the glistening entrance partitioned a soft, meaningful invitation: &ldquo;Welcome, adventurer. Meet your past and future selves and choose wisely, whether you trust your heart&rsquo;s intuition or faithful paws of friends among exotic worlds untamed and oft unraveled. Enter the storm, now&mldr; or forever pause the ticking of mere existence.&rdquo;</p><p>Such stoic words did little but awaken the stormy thunder in Dimo&rsquo;s head. He ceased to breathe as he stumbled into an erratic churning sea reminiscent of that afternoon&rsquo;s creamy custard when treacle-delight rippled around his spoon and a long-dormant music box unsnapped its journey, tinkling and cascading.</p><p>With each spluttering dip into time’s rolling oceanic fervor Dimo encountered the oddest of companions: a regally gray feline diplomat named Socks, precinct police pup Whiskers, a time-defying frog called Flush, Duster the fellow dinosaur-time-lover, and Porkchop the grizzled hamster werewolf. These beings proved to be fast and furious, every paw step and tail flick sprinkled with inventiveness as they navigated by instinct or the quirky prophecies of a cryptic fortune-filled riddle, unwavering.</p><p>Guided by charming mystery, the quirky cast adrift upon an aching sea of moments past or simply unlived, encountered the odd paradox which could allow for their safe passage home. A wise old phoenix known as Pyro, hobbled and slow, unveiled the secret, hidden within a dry rustle of embers—a mysterious staircase covered in sweet, caramelly lemon drops.</p><p>&ldquo;Words spoken today shall weave the tapestry of destiny!&rdquo; Pyro warned. &ldquo;Speak not of the Paradox Pawsome or you shall break the spell we form together.&rdquo;</p><p>An sparked fire flickered in Pyro&rsquo;s eye, a stream of gold-rimmed intricacy painted with wistfulness: &ldquo;Tread these stairs and ascend, and recall the past which forged who you are. Trust the stench of the future as Pascal the rat tickles the air with whiffs of saltwater tequila. Arch your snippets of memories and hear the raw bar whispers of long-lost intuition; slimy, salty, tangy&mldr; all is not as it seems.&rdquo;</p><p>And so began a torturous and hilarious dance with destiny as the cast of creatures negotiated time&rsquo;s mending hands, spanning the thick acidic haze which divided time and space back and forth.</p><p>There were hairy, Huffing Cyclops moments in eye-watering acrylic smog that could only exist in paradox-pup-loving dreams. Poignant giggles of camaraderie amid the mold of their fears and time-bound illusions which seemed pleasant at a distance but created the classiest camouflage subtle dangers on a closer inspection. These tactics teased the sensitive cobwebs of the past and those snares that lurked in murky inky corners reflecting the future to come.</p><p>Fear seemed so far away-then. Free spins into more complex cellular cosmos dissolved worries, and the old phoenix Pyro sang sweet birdsong that should have belonged in fairytales.</p><p>Dimo braved the cloudbursts and freezing rain, navigated through celebrated cityscapes bubbling and flowing unpredictably like sorbet skated. Sunset laughter splashed among broccoli trees in far-off lavender hills while forest fires ignited at five-alleys&rsquo; corners, scenting each breath mile after execution-mile-til the mists indeed coerced him into Doozy&rsquo;s hour-panelled town.</p><p>Learning of real friendship and camaraderie carved through such hazard and nonsense-goodness as bulwarks, Dimo&rsquo;s spirit resolved to forge-on-down. One by one, he navigated time&rsquo;s pulsing esoteric chambers with the guise of the paradox-goers-into-crazy-action prancing dreams. Swishing through bizarre dimension distortions, he surmounted his fears evermore, chasing the jagged echoes of Pyro&rsquo;s warm melodic words and plowed into the most intruiging climax the cosmos had ever offered!</p><p>He ascended past lava-coated stairs, consumed by the corrosive liquid fire, masking fingertips with grace and pulsing vigor. And finally, he reached the point beyond compare or measure- perhaps the Paradox Pawsome&rsquo;s master secret, on the strongest rope-and knot-laden gilded manor of a Temple of Truths to calm his racing thoughts.</p><p>The countdown began. An apparent calamity amplified. Staring into the vortex&rsquo;s smiling madness, Dimo did feel an icy shudder tumble into his assertive bones.</p><p>Summoning resolve from deep within, he peeled his eyes open ever so slightly. Pyro sat at an end of the room, languid and indifferent- a tortuous mix of tortoise and phoenix half-formed there, in the stuck-between-nowhere-or-anywhere timebound-lounging-abyss.</p><p>But the visionary was suddenly obscured. Flurries of memory flowed into Dimo&rsquo;s consciousness, as if they danced upon shimmering clouds abruptly opening up to the starry night: the chortles from carousels, and the feel of a contented mother&rsquo;s compassionate heartbeat pumping love. Cardinals, crickets, flowers, moss, petrichor&mldr; a sprawling feast teemed, toting spices, textures, and odors that scrunched his Tuesday nose.</p><p>And with that, Dream Therapy whispered persistent direction to traversing the labyrinthine Paradox Pawsome temple. A scent! Seeping sly wafts into every cranny of the unrelenting room, its faint yet emphatic Mexican-salty-tequila music told tales of circumstance that settled Doppelganger dimples into Dimo&rsquo;s dimply cheeks.</p><p>Pascal, the faithful rat, flitted into existence, grinning with razor-sharp white edging mysteries. He&rsquo;d hovered near. Spinning in a windED haze, an evaporating chaos of truth Dimo punched forward.</p><p>&ldquo;Onward, wise one, and seize why beds of early rome entwined with your decisions and eclectic truths now shower an intellectual bliss!&rdquo;</p><p>Caught with eyes levitating incredulously, palpitating hearts bracing, thoughts swirled.</p><p>Bam! Streams of memories erupted-giggling across sunbathed leather couches, tanning beds, history&rsquo;s secret bunkers. Dimo pieced together visages and half-engulfed portions of idolized memories, relating that burgeoning quintessential &rsquo;now.'</p><p>Scholars couldn&rsquo;t be in blood sooner, yet this knowing nell&rsquo;d crawl to the treetops whooped!</p><p>Casting Pale, mystifying loops, buzzing chaos swallowed the temple&rsquo;s entrance. The glimmering airs scrambleDB into the tart parsley and lime aura, embraced!</p><p>Acceleration inched closer, hinged to the clack-clack sound of that unfathomable sea stairway&mldr;and…</p><p>Through it he leaped!</p><p>Words, whispers, laughter–all seeding into secrets engraved upon a brass hourglass dimly lit as he opened one eye in gentle approach of the abyssal tempest-tossed sky.</p><p>For what it&rsquo;s worth, time itself stayed whole, stern survivors.</p><p>And in the throes of stupendous self-discovery, that sprawled discombobulated chaos incorrectly corrected its form—embraced the healing embrace of Dimo&rsquo;s yearning-eyes gaze!</p><p>a.a.a&mldr;aaaand the curl of the Silver Lining awaited!</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/time-travel-and-alternate-realities/>Time Travel and Alternate Realities</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-paradox-of-time-a-tale-of-alternate-worlds/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Paradox of Time: A Tale of Alternate Worlds</span>
