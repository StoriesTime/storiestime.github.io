But as an adult chasing deadlines across accountant-gray Paris, his palate dulled, his days shrank to lukewarm coffee and chain bakery quiches. One rainy evening, with drizzle streaking glass and calendar looming, he struck upon a plan—a way to remember why food once mattered.</p><p>He would travel the world through its flavors, one plate at a time. No airplanes, no bullet trains, nothing but winding railways, undulating roads, ferries across rivers more ancient than history. Eighty destinations, eighty emblematic dishes. He booked a leave of absence, stuffed a solitary backpack, and left a note for his bewildered landlord promising to return, someday, maybe with recipes to share.</p><h3 id=plate-1-bouillabaisse-in-marseille>Plate 1: Bouillabaisse in Marseille</h3><p>The old harbor seemed to smolder in the late afternoon heat, fragrant with brine and diesel and garlic. Antoine followed his nose past the rows of bare-torsoed fishermen and battered boats, down a narrow street where a hand-lettered menu promised <em>la vraie bouillabaisse</em>. He sipped an anise aperitif and listened to the owner recite the catch of the day: rascasse, mullet, conger eel. The soup arrived in a battered enamel pot, its broth nebula-golden, sliding over his tongue with fennel and saffron and the echo of deep tides. An old woman at a nearby table—perhaps the cook’s mother—nodded in approval as he mopped up every last drop with coarse bread.</p><h3 id=plate-4-paella-valenciana-in-valencia>Plate 4: Paella Valenciana in Valencia</h3><p>Spain woke Antoine with late-morning sunlight and the clang of market bells. He signed up (unwittingly) for a paella cooking class, joining a group of tourists and their gregarious teacher, Rosa. They foraged through the Mercado Central, choosing slippery clams, ruby shrimp, and a chicken thigh or two, plus <em>arroz bomba</em> from burlap sacks. Rosa showed them how to crush saffron between their fingers, to stir the rice only at precise intervals—a rule delivered with comical solemnity. The first tastes were communal and piping hot, a tapestry woven of smoked paprika, green beans, and the ocean.</p><h3 id=plate-8-tagine-in-marrakesh>Plate 8: Tagine in Marrakesh</h3><p>Red dust danced as Antoine ducked through the tangle of souks. Swallows swooped overhead and carts rattled past, heaped with purple figs. A young man beckoned him into a candlelit riad, where a bubbling tagine perfumed the air. Apricots and prunes, lamb and almonds, cinnamon, and a tart twist of preserved lemon—each bite a story centuries old, shared beneath mosaics fading to blue.</p><h3 id=plate-15-borscht-in-kyiv>Plate 15: Borscht in Kyiv</h3><p>In a basement cafe, underground from frigid winds, bowls of borscht steamed rosy and bright. The proprietor—a grandmother in a babushka—set sour cream beside Antoine with a conspiratorial wink. He spooned up the beet-stained soup, rich with beef bone, cabbage, and dill, savoring the sweetness of root vegetables balanced by vinegar and the distant tickle of black pepper. In the corner, two musicians played hulking balalaikas. By the end of his bowl, Antoine found himself swaying along.</p><h3 id=plate-21-pho-in-hanoi>Plate 21: Pho in Hanoi</h3><p>Antoine landed in Southeast Asia during the tail end of monsoon, streets glazed with rain’s memory. Following the clamor of motorbikes near Hoan Kiem Lake, he ducked into a crowded roadside stall, where a wizened woman presided over vats of simmering broth. She wove ribbons of rice noodle, cradled slices of brisket, and topped each bowl with fragrant herbs, raw onion, and a squeeze of lime. The broth was complex—an alchemy of star anise, ginger, and long-boiled bones. It conjured not only nourishment, but the feeling of home.</p><h3 id=plate-27-tom-yum-goong-in-bangkok>Plate 27: Tom Yum Goong in Bangkok</h3><p>Here, food carried the riotous energy of the city: a cacophony of citrus, chiles, lemongrass, and galangal. Antoine slurped steaming tom yum by Chao Phraya’s banks, every spoonful a shock and delight. His lips tingled with sour, his nose cleared by red chilies. Nearby, monks walked barefoot between the cacophony of tuk-tuks. The soup had bite, both literal and metaphorical; its shrimp tumbled out succulent, pink, and hot.</p><h3 id=plate-34-sushi-in-tokyo>Plate 34: Sushi in Tokyo</h3><p>Clean lines, unbroken silence: the old sushi counter was a stage, its chef stern as a sensei. Antoine surrendered to omakase, trusting the artist behind the counter. Precision slices of toro, sweet uni, and briny ika slid across the tongue, each grain of rice a sculpture. Wasabi cleared his sinuses, pickled ginger reset the stages. The chef did not speak, but Antoine found conversation in the fish.</p><h3 id=plate-40-bibimbap-in-seoul>Plate 40: Bibimbap in Seoul</h3><p>Beneath neon-lit Hanok eaves, Antoine learned the art of the bibimbap bowl—a universe within one vessel. He watched as thin-sliced vegetables, marinated beef, fried egg, and fiery gochujang arranged themselves atop warm rice. Mixing them together, steam rising in aromatic clouds, he felt the collision of earth and spice, the simple joy of textures blending in harmony.</p><h3 id=plate-45-doro-wat-in-addis-ababa>Plate 45: Doro Wat in Addis Ababa</h3><p>Ethiopian hospitality enveloped Antoine with hands stained by berbere. He joined strangers over injera and spicy chicken stew, fingers tearing the sour bread and dipping it, eyes meeting above the communal plate. The heat built slowly—layer by layer, cinnamon and clove and pepper swirling amid tender drumsticks and boiled egg. The coffee ceremony that followed, potent and perfumed, left Antoine awake and smiling into the street’s golden dusk.</p><h3 id=plate-50-bunny-chow-in-durban>Plate 50: Bunny Chow in Durban</h3><p>Rain beat on the tin roof as Antoine queued at the little canteen, watching the cook hollow out a loaf of white bread and fill it with lamb curry, fragrant and fiery. He ate with his hands, and the sauce stained his skin, mixing laughter, chili, and chutney. Outsiders grumbled about the mess, but Antoine found pleasure in the spill of sauce running down his wrist: cuisine unpretentious, generous, jubilant with spice.</p><h3 id=plate-56-feijoada-in-rio-de-janeiro>Plate 56: Feijoada in Rio de Janeiro</h3><p>Sunlight poured heavy as Antoine perched by Copacabana, sharing a feast after samba lessons in Lapa. The black bean stew—rich with pork, sausage, orange, and kale—was hearty, homey, and deeply comforting. He sipped caipirinha and listened to new friends tell stories of Carnival and heartbreak. Beans, it seemed, were the very language of community.</p><h3 id=plate-64-mole-poblano-in-puebla>Plate 64: Mole Poblano in Puebla</h3><p>Mexico crackled with the pulse of mariachis, with laughter over shared tequila. In Puebla, at a centuries-old convent now a restaurant, Antoine ordered mole. The sauce was thick and dark, cocoa and chiles welded into a dynasty. It wrapped around chicken like a velvet cloak, smoky and elusive, each forkful a puzzle of almond, raisin, sesame, and spice. For dessert, he drank hot chocolate whipped foamy in the old way.</p><h3 id=plate-71-poutine-in-montreal>Plate 71: Poutine in Montreal</h3><p>Snow muffled Antoine’s boots as he ducked into the warmth of a Quebecoise diner. There, fries, cheese curds, and dark gravy melded into a heart-stopping, artery-thickening delight. It was a dish that demanded nothing—no elegance, no pretense. He ate it next to college kids, old men, and sleepy truckers, all united in the balm of comfort food.</p><h3 id=plate-76-clam-chowder-in-boston>Plate 76: Clam Chowder in Boston</h3><p>Fog hung over the harbor, and Antoine’s breath curled in the early chill. He found himself in an old tavern, wood-paneled and full of the scent of thyme and celery. New England clam chowder—creamy, briny, and speckled with potato and crispy bacon—arrived with Boston brown bread and soft butter. He let the steam warm his face and the flavors anchor him to coast and hearth and kin.</p><h3 id=plate-80-home>Plate 80: Home</h3><p>When at last Antoine returned to Paris, timeworn boots and a battered notebook his souvenirs, he realized the journey had been less about ticking countries off a list and more about letting each recipe ferry a life from one kitchen table to another. He invited friends and neighbors—old and new—to a dinner party spanning his globe-trotting year.</p><p>The table groaned beneath saffron rice, thick bread, fermenting cabbages, stews he’d once fumbled in foreign kitchens, spice jars with labels in myriad scripts. As he ladled soup and toasted with wine, Antoine understood the invisible threads connecting plate to plate, story to story.</p><p>It was not the distance that changed him, but the act of tasting with curiosity and reverence. The world, he thought, was stitched together by the alchemy of kitchens, the faith of cooks, and the miracle of sharing—around the world in eighty plates, and back home again, richer in every sense of the word.</p><hr><p>Antoine’s journey lingered, not only in hand-scrawled recipes and spice-stained clothing but in the way he listened now when someone described a childhood meal, or fished a packet from a foreign grocery for him to try. His appetite persisted, and in quiet moments, he dreamed of the plates left untasted, the stories still waiting for their seat at the table.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/culinary-adventures/>Culinary Adventures</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/around-the-world-in-80-dishes-a-culinary-story/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Around the World in 80 Dishes: A Culinary Story</span>
