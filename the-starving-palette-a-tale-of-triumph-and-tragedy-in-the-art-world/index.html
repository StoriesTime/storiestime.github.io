His canvas remained barren, yet his soul screamed to burst forth upon charcoaled boards. Some whispered the melancholy painted on Henri&rsquo;s visage mirrored what lay eviscerated and barren within his studio. It was called The Starving Palette, a whimsical haunt perpetrated against the shadow of ancient Montmartre.</p><p>Though the Vatican&rsquo;s glossy hallways reverberated in exaltation of his impressive earlier works, the ardent admiration of the art world seemed but a dimming flame. In an age brimming with Crayola vibrance and audacity, Henri &ldquo;&lsquo;Van Gogh&rsquo;&rsquo;&rdquo; clung to his paintbrush like a moth ensnared in the pheromones of a flickering flame.</p><p>The summer afternoon sun sighed its golden melody through the studio&rsquo;s solitary, diminutive window, painting aching reminders of the hour in the dust motes that swirled within the shafts of light. Henri gazed expectantly, upper lip caressed ever so tenderly by the bristles of his brush. He had a name once; now but a ghost, haunting a life no longer familiar. Now called Van Gogh, he exhaled a lumpen sigh, and the brush captured his despair anew on the familiar white expanse.</p><p>Somewhere deep in the bowels of Montmartre, they spoke his name anew. The underbelly was riddled with starving artists who had traded their dreams for opulent resignation and societal acceptance. Struggling artists found a haven, some talent rejuvenated by the lust for life only these desperate souls could muster. Their gossip-laden conversations would soon unearth tales of the now legendary painter, Van Gogh.</p><p>A timid girl with slivers of sunlit hair strayed shyly through the crowded lair bearing an emerald apple painted into its flesh. She was enamored by tales of Van Gogh&rsquo;s paintings, with their scattershot swaths of color in abject rebellion against reality. Defiantly, she dreamt of laying her own tales upon the Stone Angels that stood like sentinels guarding the entrance of The Starving Palette. She introduced herself as Gauguin.</p><p>Drawn together like moths, Gauguin and Van Gogh marveled in being spirits displaced among the living. They played out their melancholic symphony in the dimly lit corners of their haven, Van Gogh&rsquo;s starved emotions casting a poignantly Nathanial sense of beauty onto sculpted rags. Van Gogh&rsquo;s raw passion spilled onto the slums of Montmartre like an albatross screeching for a world that wished to disentangle itself but could not. Gauguin, with windswept hair and sun-weary fingers, matched Van Gogh&rsquo;s fervor in painting Pan&rsquo;s intoxicated serenade through The Starving Palette.</p><p>Paris slowly awoke to the harmonious cacophony of Van Gogh and Gauguin&rsquo;s unanticipated masterpieces. Critics and collectors craved the ashen gloss and gold-streaked skies of the Montmartre mural. Night fell on Paris, as the colors fused into a quivering symphony of unimaginable colors, and somewhere between waking and dreaming, they would bond together, a wild charging of tamed passions.</p><p>For a transient time, Montmartre contemplated a renaissance. Shadows and sunsets collided in a tumult of hues never before seen. Yet amidst this vibrant collision, Van Gogh&rsquo;s fear reverberated like a gong in his hollow chest, echoing within the cracks of his soul. The indulgence of ecstasy, love, and passion would one day wane into a heart-stopping void.</p><p>As summer waned and Parisian leaves turned amber and gold, a wistful letter arrived, a ghostly love song jaded by the history of severed dreams. Gauguin, summoned by the siren call of Tahiti, quarantined his soul for eternity, leaving Van Gogh ensnared by the cobweb-laced embrace of triumph and tragedy. Emotion and intellect, spirit and flesh, entwined like serpents, as he voyaged inside the boundless colors of his mind.</p><p>One breathless night, Van Gogh&rsquo;s canvas filled with dreams birthed in pained fingers, breathing life into an alliance of symmetry and chaos. It was his best yet, glistening like a jewel against the dusky walls adorned by Gauguin&rsquo;s own vibrant offerings. It would be his last.</p><p>In the brief, ephemeral moments of celebration within their haven, Van Gogh&rsquo;s withdrawn gaze sought out the vibrant colors that had tilted the balance between existence and oblivion - it was time to cast his soul into the churning seas of eternity.</p><p>And so, it was on a somber April morn, when Van Gogh left behind The Starving Palette and his last untouched canvas on an adjoining windowsill. For the colors he left behind were buried in the trenches of his canvas.</p><p>They would remember him as but a man. Van Gogh, Gauguin, and the ephemeral majesty born from the collaboration of a whispering wind and color. For their colors flowed into sunlight, tickled the darkness, danced over the horizon, and boldly roared their haunting serenity, an indelible stamp upon the art world entwined with triumph and tragedy.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/artistic-struggles/>Artistic Struggles</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-stage-beckons-a-theater-actors-struggle-for-recognition/><span class=title>Â« Prev</span><br><span>The Stage Beckons: A Theater Actor's Struggle for Recognition</span>
