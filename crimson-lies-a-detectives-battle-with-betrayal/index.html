The image, curled from age, was of four people—shoulder to shoulder, eyes red from the flash, drunken grins beneath carnival lights. The San Gallo Carnival, the night fate rearranged Detective Julia Vega’s life like bones in a grave. And now, nearly a decade later, every color in the photograph oozed betrayal.</p><p>Rain battered the old bricks of Greywater Precinct, lashing against her office window as if to punctuate the case file spread across her desk. Julia’s badge glinted dully besides the mug of cold coffee. This was her last chance, and she knew it.</p><p><strong>Case Name: Crimson Lies—The Romero Murder and subsequent investigations.</strong></p><p><strong>Primary Suspects:</strong></p><ul><li>Linda Cole – Former best friend, now a rising politician.</li><li>Edgar Shaw – Police colleague, and lately, evasive.</li><li>Simon Barr—Carnival owner, and the only one of them who’d always told the truth nobody wanted to hear.</li></ul><p>But someone among them had twisted loyalty into violence, and Julia’s own dogged pursuit of the truth had cost her more than a few friends. Even in the force, mutters trailed behind her: <em>Vega clings to ghosts</em>. Maybe so. But the ghosts of San Gallo Carnival did more than linger—they whispered.</p><hr><h2 id=chapter-1-blood-under-neon-lights><strong>Chapter 1: Blood Under Neon Lights</strong></h2><p>She returned to the scene—more for herself than the investigation. San Gallo Carnival reopened each spring, as if nothing had bled out beneath its Ferris wheel. The damp dirt squelched under her boots as she entered the fairgrounds, scents of popcorn, spilled beer, and engine oil hanging in the air.</p><p>“Detective Vega?” The voice was unfamiliar; a young officer with a nervous look and a rain-slicked notebook. “Are you here about the Romero case?”</p><p>She watched a cluster of teenagers drift past, their laughter biting. “The Romero case? I never left it,” Julia murmured, scanning the perimeter. “Most people moved on. I didn’t.”</p><p>He shifted, clearly uncomfortable. “Uh, right. Carnival workers say you’ve been around before. Old ghosts, huh?”</p><p>She walked on, not waiting for him to follow. Deep inside, she felt the scene tugging her back through time: screaming lights, a shattered bottle, Ricardo Romero sprawled in a pool too crimson to ignore. The night Ricardo died, laughter gave way to sirens. Julia remembered her own memories like so much shattered glass: Linda’s lipstick smudged, Edgar with knuckles raw, Simon’s quiet voice, “It wasn’t an accident, Julia.”</p><p>That was when everything started to break.</p><hr><h2 id=chapter-2-the-first-crack><strong>Chapter 2: The First Crack</strong></h2><p>Back in the precinct, Julia reviewed evidence long dismissed by others. The files were brittle from handling. Fingerprints, security footage, phone transcripts: all puzzle pieces everyone agreed didn’t quite fit. She’d spent years rearranging them late into the night, in the hope the edges would someday lock together.</p><p>One afternoon, her phone buzzed. There was no name, just a message: <em>“Heard you still keep secrets. You should talk to Linda. She isn’t as trustworthy as she looks.”</em></p><p>Her pulse quickened. She hadn’t spoken to Linda in years, not since Linda made city council and Julia became the precinct’s black sheep. Interviewing her would be war, but she dialed the number anyway.</p><p>To her surprise, Linda answered on the second ring—her voice as polished and double-edged as ever. “Is this about Ricardo?” she asked, skipping pleasantries.</p><p>“Did you want to speak in person?”</p><p>A pause. “I suppose you’ll insist. My office. Tomorrow.”</p><p>Julia left the precinct with her stomach knotted and mind full of scenarios.</p><hr><h2 id=chapter-3-an-old-friends-smile><strong>Chapter 3: An Old Friend’s Smile</strong></h2><p>Linda’s office was all gleaming glass and expensive art. Outwardly the portrait of civic virtue, Linda looked at Julia with a clinical smile.</p><p>“You know why I’m here.”</p><p>Linda’s grin shrank by degrees. “Julia, this again? Every year you revive this case like a superstition.”</p><p>“I have new information. Tell me about the threats Ricardo got. You told the police they were harmless. Did you lie?”</p><p>Linda tapped her nails against her thigh. “Ricardo gambled, you know that. He owed money all over town. But—" she hesitated, “If you’re asking if I killed him, it’s still no.”</p><p>Julia stared, remembering the brittle trust they once shared. “Maybe not. Maybe someone wanted to frame you. Did you ever feel watched back then? Or now?”</p><p>That got a reaction—Linda’s eyes darted towards the window. “Julia, drop this. You’re not on the case. You’re never going to clear your own name this way.”</p><p>But that was just it. Julia didn’t care about her own name.</p><hr><h2 id=chapter-4-shadows-within><strong>Chapter 4: Shadows Within</strong></h2><p>Back at her apartment, Julia pored through years of police emails and case notes, looking for threads. Names, dates, debts. She scrolled to the witness list, her eyes snagging on a detail she’d never taken seriously: Simon Barr had left the carnival that night for over an hour, his whereabouts unaccounted for. No one pressed; he wasn’t a suspect then. But why?</p><p>She called him.</p><p>Simon answered. His voice, quiet and tired, came through the phone. “You still chasing shadows?”</p><p>Julia tried not to let her desperation bleed through. “Simon, I need to know where you went that night. The hours after Ricardo was found—someone said they saw you in the north corridor, by the staff trailers.”</p><p>Simon’s silence was heavy.</p><p>Then, “Meet me by the funhouse. After dark. No cops. No one else.”</p><hr><h2 id=chapter-5-the-funhouses-reflection><strong>Chapter 5: The Funhouse&rsquo;s Reflection</strong></h2><p>The funhouse was ancient—mirrors warped and floors sticky from generations of spilled soda. Julia’s footsteps echoed as she waited. Simon materialized from the gloom, smoking a cigarette.</p><p>He pointed at the mirrors. “Ever wonder why detectives pace through funhouses in books? It’s not the mirrors. It’s so they can see their own mistakes all around them. You’re in a loop, Julia. You wonder who betrayed who. But it was all of us. Even Ricardo.”</p><p>Julia’s voice was low. “Did you kill him, Simon?”</p><p>He shook his head. “No. But I know who set him up, and why.”</p><p>Julia stared. He tossed his cigarette to the floor, crushing it. “Ricardo was going to rat on the gambling ring Edgar ran out the back. Edgar found out and beat him up—didn’t mean to kill him, but the damage was done. Linda cleaned up the mess. She called in a favor to a doctor she knew, staged it as an accident. Then she shut you and me out. You remember what happened after.”</p><p>Julia’s pulse thundered. “Why now?”</p><p>Simon grimaced. “Because someone’s coming after me, saying I have files. You need to get to Edgar—he keeps the records. Always did. But he’s scared of you.”</p><p>In the mirrors, Julia saw herself multiplied—a cop, an outcast, still the only one chasing a broken truth.</p><hr><h2 id=chapter-6-the-colleagues-confession><strong>Chapter 6: The Colleague’s Confession</strong></h2><p>Julia found Edgar in a dive bar, drowning old guilt in cheap whiskey. He eyed her with wariness as she took the barstool beside him.</p><p>“Haven’t you given up?”</p><p>She shook her head. “Simon says you kept records. The gambling, the payoffs. I need to see them. It’s the only way the truth lives on beyond us.”</p><p>Edgar looked at her, his eyes hollow. “We all covered for Linda. The council, the election—they needed her clean. Ricardo thought he could walk away. After that night, I realized the system eats you alive unless you play along.”</p><p>“Show me the files, Edgar.”</p><p>He downed his whiskey, then slid a battered USB stick across the bar.</p><p>On it, he promised, were enough secrets to bring down everyone who’d touched the night of Romero’s death—including Julia herself, who hadn’t pushed hard enough when she should have, who let friendship override suspicion.</p><hr><h2 id=chapter-7-the-betrayal-unmasked><strong>Chapter 7: The Betrayal Unmasked</strong></h2><p>The files were a spider’s web. Names, bribes, debts, threats—all linking Linda, Edgar, Simon, even Julia’s own early reports. The police chief, the carnival’s mayoral donors, the doctor who falsified Romero’s records. The betrayal wasn’t a single act. It was a communal self-preservation, disguised as justice.</p><p>Julia sat at her tiny kitchen table, lit by the glow of her laptop, nausea rolling through her. She could turn it all in, destroy careers, burn bridges, destroy the lives of people she’d once called family. Or, she could bury the file, protect what was left of the city’s brittle peace.</p><p>She wasn’t sure she was the hero anymore.</p><p>Her phone buzzed. It was Linda, her voice urgent, tight with fear.</p><p>“Heard Edgar gave you something. Meet me. Please.”</p><p>They met in the public park, rain blurring the world between them. Linda’s face was drawn.</p><p>“If you release those files, the election’s over. But you’ll also go down, Julia. Everyone will.”</p><p>Julia stared. “We built this city on a lie, Linda. How long before it all falls apart anyway?”</p><p>Linda reached out, desperation in her eyes. “You want the truth, but is this about Ricardo or about proving you didn’t betray us first?”</p><p>It’s a question Julia couldn’t answer. Not yet.</p><hr><h2 id=chapter-8-crimson-choices><strong>Chapter 8: Crimson Choices</strong></h2><p>The press conference room was packed, city reporters grumbling about leaks and accountability. Julia had decided. Truth didn’t guarantee justice, but secrets fermented into poison.</p><p>She watched as Linda made her prepared speech, smile brittle, hair immaculate. Edgar hovered behind, resigned. Even Simon showed, standing in the back, expression hidden.</p><p>Julia stepped up, holding the files—digital, powerful, damning. She looked at the assembled faces, eyes brimming with suspicion and expectation. The air trembled.</p><p>“I have information about the events surrounding the death of Ricardo Romero. There’s more to the story than what was reported, and the truth involves people at every level of city government, police, and business.”</p><p>A hush swept the room. Julia’s fingers trembled, but her voice held.</p><p>“Crimson lies built this city. We all played our part. Today, I’m putting an end to it.”</p><p>She handed the files to the city’s attorney, watching as the dominos began to fall. Betrayal was a cold, iron kind of justice.</p><hr><h2 id=chapter-9-fallout><strong>Chapter 9: Fallout</strong></h2><p>In days, headlines blazed:</p><p><strong>CARNIVAL CORRUPTION: POLICE TIED TO COUNCIL COVER-UPS</strong></p><p><strong>DETECTIVE REVEALS LYING OFFICERS, POLITICIANS IN MURDER PROBE</strong></p><p>Julia watched from her apartment, knowing she was now just as much a pariah as she was a whistleblower. Edgar resigned; Linda’s career flamed out in public shame. Simon disappeared, finding solace—perhaps—under neon lights somewhere new.</p><p>She was alone. But, for the first time in nearly a decade, she could look at the photograph and see not just smiling faces doomed by secrets, but survivors. Tainted, yes. But free.</p><hr><h2 id=chapter-10-the-new-carnival><strong>Chapter 10: The New Carnival</strong></h2><p>A new season opened at San Gallo Carnival. Julia walked the grounds, senses sharper, soul battered but clean. Beneath the Ferris wheel, children laughed. An old woman sold candied apples, not knowing what the ground beneath her shoes had witnessed.</p><p>A teenager dropped her ticket. Julia stooped to pick it up—and for an instant, saw the world as it could have been: unscarred, untainted.</p><p>She stood, breathing in the scent of sugar and hope. Somewhere in the distance, police sirens wailed—not for her, nor for anything hidden. Just the everyday.</p><p>She dropped the battered photograph into a trash can and walked on, head high. Every city hid its own crimson lies. Some people just fought harder to bring them into the light.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/crime-and-detective-stories/>Crime and Detective Stories</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/crimson-lies-a-crime-that-no-one-saw-coming/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Crimson Lies: A Crime That No One Saw Coming</span>
