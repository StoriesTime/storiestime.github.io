The cobblestone streets were slick with water, and the distant sound of thunder reverberated through the alleyways. She had never meant to find herself in this part of town, but when the ad for the old, mysterious antiques shop appeared in the paper, her curiosity got the better of her.</p><p>Inside, the shop was dimly lit, filled with a faint scent of dust and old wood. Shelves upon shelves of forgotten treasures stretched along the walls, their surfaces layered with a history no one had bothered to recall for years. As Evelyn wandered deeper, her fingers brushing over tarnished brass and chipped porcelain, she felt a strange pull towards something in the back corner of the shop.</p><p>There, half-hidden beneath a faded velvet cloth, stood an old mirror. Unlike the other antiques, it was unpolished, its glass surface clouded with time. The frame was intricately carved, an ornate masterpiece that seemed to hum with an eerie energy. Evelyn&rsquo;s heart skipped a beat as she gazed at it, almost as though it was calling her name. She stepped closer.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, you&rsquo;ve found the mirror,&rdquo; came a raspy voice from behind her. Startled, Evelyn turned to see the shopkeeper—a frail old man with wisps of white hair. His eyes were narrow, almost too knowing. &ldquo;It’s a rare piece, that one. Came from an old estate in the countryside.&rdquo;</p><p>Evelyn nodded, her fingers tracing the edge of the mirror’s frame. &ldquo;What’s its story?&rdquo;</p><p>The man hesitated, his gaze flicking nervously to the mirror before settling back on her. &ldquo;Well, it’s said to be haunted, you see. The previous owner was&mldr; not quite the same after they had it. They were never quite right, always whispering about the ghosts they saw in the reflection. But that’s all just stories&mldr; isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; His words trailed off, as if he was unsure whether he was trying to convince her or himself.</p><p>Evelyn’s curiosity was piqued, and she found herself asking, &ldquo;How much is it?&rdquo;</p><p>The shopkeeper’s lips twitched into a thin smile. &ldquo;For you, a fair price. But I must warn you—the mirror is not just an object. It has a history, and those who look too deeply into it may find more than they bargained for.&rdquo;</p><p>Evelyn, ever the skeptic, simply smiled. &ldquo;I’m not afraid of ghosts.&rdquo;</p><p>With that, she handed over the money, feeling the weight of the mirror in her arms as she left the shop.</p><hr><p>That night, as the storm continued to rage outside, Evelyn placed the mirror in the living room of her apartment. It stood on the floor, casting strange reflections across the room, its surface cloudy and unsettling. She studied it for a while, noting how the light seemed to shift around it, as if it was not quite in harmony with the rest of the room.</p><p>But she didn’t believe in ghosts—at least not yet. It was just a mirror, a relic with a rich history. The thought of the shopkeeper’s warning seemed absurd in the face of her practical mind.</p><p>She turned away and made herself a cup of tea, her thoughts occupied with the hectic workday she’d left behind. But as she sipped the tea, something caught her attention. In the reflection of the mirror, something moved.</p><p>Evelyn froze, staring at the glass. At first, she thought it was just a trick of the light, the storm outside casting fleeting shadows that played across the surface. But the movement was deliberate, unmistakable. A figure—faint and indistinct—moved across the reflection.</p><p>Her heart pounded in her chest as she stepped closer to the mirror. The figure became clearer—a woman in a long, dark dress, her face obscured by shadow. Evelyn could not tear her eyes away from the sight, her mind racing to rationalize what she was seeing.</p><p>She reached out, her fingers brushing against the glass. But as her hand met the surface, a chill ran through her body, as if the air had turned suddenly cold.</p><p>The woman in the reflection tilted her head, her features coming into focus for a brief moment. Evelyn gasped, stepping back. The woman’s eyes were hollow, dark voids that seemed to look right through her. Her mouth opened, but no sound came forth.</p><p>Suddenly, the reflection flickered, and the woman was gone.</p><p>Evelyn blinked, her breath catching in her throat. The room was still, silent once more. The mirror was just a mirror, nothing more.</p><p>But Evelyn couldn’t shake the feeling that something had shifted. Something had stirred in the glass, something that didn’t belong.</p><hr><p>The next few days were a blur. Evelyn couldn’t stop thinking about the mirror. Despite the eerie feeling it gave her, she refused to believe in anything supernatural. But every time she passed by it, she felt that unsettling presence.</p><p>At night, she couldn’t help but glance at it, her mind half-terrified, half-intrigued. And then, one night, it happened again.</p><p>She was reading a book in bed when she felt a presence in the room. Slowly, she turned her head toward the mirror. There, in the reflection, was the same woman—her face clearer now, her eyes wide and pleading, as if begging for something.</p><p>Evelyn couldn’t move. It was as though she were trapped between the world she knew and the one in the mirror. She watched as the woman’s lips moved soundlessly, her expression growing more desperate.</p><p>Suddenly, the woman reached out of the mirror. Evelyn gasped, her heart pounding in her chest as she scrambled backward, but the woman’s hand—pale and thin—was already reaching for her.</p><p>In a flash, the hand made contact, and the world around Evelyn seemed to shift. The room blurred, and her vision darkened.</p><p>When she awoke, she was no longer in her apartment. The air was damp, and the room was lit only by the faint glow of candles. The walls were stone, the floor cold beneath her feet. She tried to move, but her body felt heavy, as if she were wading through water.</p><p>And then she saw it—the mirror, standing tall in the center of the room. It wasn’t just any mirror. This one was framed with the same ornate carvings, but it was ancient, its glass smooth and clear. But as Evelyn stepped closer, she realized something horrifying: the reflection wasn’t of the room behind her—it was of the very place she was standing in, as if she had been transported into the world inside the mirror.</p><p>The woman stood there, her hollow eyes staring at Evelyn, beckoning her forward.</p><p>Evelyn’s heart raced. She had to escape, had to get out of the mirror before it swallowed her completely. But as she turned to run, the room around her seemed to close in, the walls shifting and pulsating like they were alive.</p><p>The woman’s voice echoed in her mind, a whisper that she couldn’t ignore. &ldquo;You are mine now,&rdquo; it said, the words hollow and chilling.</p><p>Evelyn screamed, but the sound was swallowed by the glass.</p><hr><p>The shopkeeper’s voice echoed through the darkened room of the antique store, as if he were speaking to her from another world. &ldquo;Some mirrors&mldr; they don’t just reflect the present. They hold onto the past, to the souls that have been lost or trapped. They invite the dead to linger in their glass.&rdquo;</p><p>When the authorities found Evelyn’s apartment days later, they found nothing but the mirror—still standing in the corner, its surface now impossibly smooth, reflecting only the quiet emptiness of the room. The only trace of Evelyn was a single, faint, handwritten note she had left behind:</p><p><em>&ldquo;Don’t trust what you see in the glass.&rdquo;</em></p><p>And though the mirror remained, the ghost that had haunted it was never seen again.</p><p>Until the next curious soul stepped inside the shop.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/ghost-stories/>Ghost Stories</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-night-the-spirits-walked-ghost-stories-for-the-brave/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Night the Spirits Walked: Ghost Stories for the Brave</span>
