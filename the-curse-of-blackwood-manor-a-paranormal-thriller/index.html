For years, the mansion had been the subject of whispered tales in the small, neighboring town of Ashmere. Some claimed it was cursed; others swore they had seen the flicker of candles through its shattered windows long after midnight. But few dared approach it, and even fewer returned to tell the tales.</p><p>Marion Dempsey ran a shaky hand through her chestnut hair as she stood before the wrought-iron gates now choked with vines. She hesitated. The air carried a palpable stillness, as though the forest around her held its breath. Her brother, Owen, had dared her to spend a single night inside Blackwood Manor, and Marion wasn’t one to back down from a challenge—especially not from Owen.</p><p>The gates groaned open, their rusted hinges shrieking like wailing spirits. The path leading up to the mansion was overgrown with an unyielding tangle of ivy and moss. Blackwood Manor loomed ahead, its Gothic spires cutting through the dim sky. The windows, shattered in places and obscured by grime, gave the sensation of unseen eyes watching her approach.</p><p>With a deep breath, Marion pushed forward.</p><hr><p>The front doors were, surprisingly, unlocked. They swung open with unnatural ease, revealing the grand foyer within. Dust coated every surface, yet the faint scent of lavender lingered in the air—a strange contradiction in an otherwise decaying home. The chandelier above, once opulent with crystals, was draped in cobwebs. Faint moonlight filtered through the windows, casting beams of silver across the checkered marble floor.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo; she called, her voice echoing through the cavernous space. The sound of her own voice startled her. It wasn’t like she expected anyone to answer, but something about this house made the silence unbearable.</p><p>The dare was simple: spend one night inside Blackwood Manor. Come sunrise, she’d walk out and claim bragging rights for life. Marion had prepared herself for the usual fright tactics Owen might use—rigging up speakers, fake skeletons, or maybe just hiding in the shadows to jump out at her—but as she stood there, her gut told her this was something different. The air seemed thicker in here, almost electric, and her skin prickled as if unseen eyes were tracing her every move.</p><p>She took out her phone to check her flashlight, but inexplicably, the screen flickered and died. &ldquo;Great,&rdquo; she muttered under her breath. She had charged the phone fully before leaving home.</p><p>Her instincts said to leave, but her pride wouldn’t let her.</p><hr><p>She wandered deeper into the house, tracing her fingers lightly along the faded wallpaper. Paintings adorned the walls, each one of a somber-faced person dressed in Victorian attire. Their eyes seemed to follow her, no matter where she moved. At the end of the corridor, she stopped before an ornate mirror. Its edges were framed with intricate carvings of twisting roses and thorn-covered vines.</p><p>As Marion peered into the glass, her reflection seemed almost&mldr; wrong. The room behind her was visible, but she swore there was movement in the corner of her eye—shadows that twisted from the edges of her vision, refusing to be pinned down. A cold sensation gripped her as she leaned closer to the glass. That’s when she saw it.</p><p>A pair of glowing, icy-blue eyes in the reflection. They were not hers, and they stared back at her from just over her shoulder.</p><p>Marion whipped around with a strangled gasp, but nothing was there. The hallway was entirely empty.</p><hr><p>Her breathing quickened, and a voice in her head screamed for her to leave. But fear had frozen her feet in place. Slowly, she backed away from the mirror and turned into the nearest room. It appeared to have been a sitting room at one point, though the furniture lay in ruins. A massive fireplace dominated one wall, cold and unlit. Above it, a portrait hung, coated in a thick layer of dust.</p><p>Unable to resist, Marion reached up to wipe the grime away, revealing the face beneath. It depicted a woman in an elegant emerald gown, her dark hair pinned up with pearls. Her face bore an unsettling expression—a mixture of haunting beauty and deep sorrow. But it wasn’t her features alone that made Marion’s stomach drop.</p><p>The woman in the painting had the same icy-blue eyes she had just seen in the mirror.</p><p>The temperature in the room plummeted. Marion’s breath came out in visible puffs, and a voice—low and rasping—whispered from seemingly nowhere.</p><p>&ldquo;Why have you come here?&rdquo;</p><p>Marion spun around, her courage beginning to crumble. &ldquo;Who… Who’s there?&rdquo; she stammered, her voice barely above a whisper.</p><p>The whispering grew louder, overlapping, until it became impossible to tell if it was one voice or many. Words echoed through her head, fragments of sentences: <em>&ldquo;Free us… They won’t rest… The curse…&rdquo;</em> Doors slammed in the distance, and she heard footsteps rushing through the hallways.</p><p>Panic overtook her. She bolted from the sitting room, desperate to find an exit. The house seemed to twist around her as though it were alive. Corridors that should have led to the front door instead led her deeper into its labyrinthine halls. The air smelled of damp earth and rotting wood.</p><p>In her frantic search, she stumbled into what appeared to be a library. Shelves lined the walls from floor to ceiling, crammed with leather-bound books. Dust motes floated in the air, illuminated by the faint glow of a candelabra on a central table. Unlike the rest of the house, the candles were lit, burning steadily despite the absence of any wind.</p><p>On the table lay an open journal. Marion hesitated but stepped closer, drawn by an inexplicable urge to read its contents. The handwriting was elegant but erratic, as though the author had written in haste.</p><p><em>“The curse… it holds us all within these walls. None can leave, not while her spirit lingers. She takes them, one by one, promising freedom, but it is a lie. If you are reading this, beware the Lady of Blackwood Manor. She will stop at nothing to escape her fate… even if it means condemning another in her place.”</em></p><p>As she read, a faint sound reached her ears—a soft, melodic humming. It came from somewhere nearby and sent shivers down her spine. Marion looked up, her heart hammering. Standing in the doorway was the woman from the portrait.</p><p>Her eyes were impossibly cold, piercing through Marion as though she could read her very soul. The woman smiled faintly, but her expression was devoid of warmth.</p><p>&ldquo;You’ve come to free me,&rdquo; the woman said, her voice smooth and lilting. &ldquo;How kind of you to answer the call.&rdquo;</p><hr><p>Marion stumbled back, knocking into the table. &ldquo;No—I didn’t— I was dared to come here, that’s all! I don’t want anything to do with this!&rdquo;</p><p>The woman tilted her head, the smile fading into something unreadable. Shadows stretched unnaturally from the corners of the room, curling closer like tendrils. &ldquo;You came of your own will,&rdquo; the woman said, stepping closer. &ldquo;And now, you belong to Blackwood.&rdquo;</p><p>The room spun, and Marion felt herself being pulled downward by an unseen force. The last thing she saw was the woman’s icy-blue gaze.</p><hr><p>When dawn broke over Ashmere, Blackwood Manor appeared as silent and lifeless as ever. But those who dared to look closely would swear that a new face had appeared in one of the mansion’s portraits—a young woman with chestnut hair and a look of eternal terror frozen on her face.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/supernatural-and-paranormal/>Supernatural and Paranormal</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/supernatural-whispers-a-collection-of-chilling-short-stories/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Supernatural Whispers: A Collection of Chilling Short Stories</span>
