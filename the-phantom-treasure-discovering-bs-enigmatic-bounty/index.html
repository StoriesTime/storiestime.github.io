B himself was known as the Phantom of Gpreciu, a victim of self-inflicted albinism; his sightless, silver eyes could behold the texture of the future.</p><p>His life was an infinitesimal speck of time since the day when he had been awarded an inheritance of titanic wealth after the great Stock Market Crash. The magnificent locket was said to contain the master key which would unlock – oh! Such unimagined treasures! Jewels, rubies, ancient scrolls written in mystic language that would tell you every secret ever known, onwards to the time of the first ripples in the cosmic pond of origin. B had amassed the fortune and was in possession of the locket, but chose solitude over the riches. On one sanguinary eve, he drenched the gold in blackest ink and scried the future. This forlorn act left him unseeing, but saw and witnessed more than eyes could handle.</p><p>He lived in a time of suffering, when ten men had to toil to produce what one man could do in ease. The innocence of yore was gone, never to return. The lights of the cities went out as he had prophesied and, by the dim light of his blackened vision, B began to craft. An enthralling artifact, an enigma wrapped in the velocity of time – The Treasure of Enigma.</p><p>One day, a curious soul named Zarik stumbled onto the shores of the island – having seen it once in his dreams, but only in wolfish shapes amidst thoughts of untold fortune. The wind stormed through the viewport of a broken clock, time accelerated to an unfathomable velocity, and B, hidden in the shadows, whispered the words that changed Zarik&rsquo;s journey:</p><p>&ldquo;Now you see, Enigma is out there, waiting to bestow its wondrous treasure, and I am but its instrument. Seek, you must. And when you find, do not be misled by its captivating beauty. The real prize is the knowledge of its truth, the secret of its power.&rdquo;</p><p>This set Zarik on a scramble to escape the snare of the deceptive glitz, shimmer and shine, unwrap the enigma, and apprehend the power of the Unseelie hour.</p><p>The powerful enigma rested dormant in the realm of tormented dreams, waiting for its unworthy victim-wielder, blessed by the vatic hand of B. But there was another player lurking within the Reactor of Prestige – Eban, an old and weathered pirate, serving B&rsquo;s whim as his dour emissary spy, riddled with ulterior motives.</p><p>Eban received word of Zarik&rsquo;s sighting and studied him with eyes as empty and cold as the vaults of his heart. As B had maintained the genius loci, Eban couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder about the contents hidden within the mysterious locket.</p><p>B knew Eban&rsquo;s mind was a bottomless pit of cunning, paranoia, and greed. The treasure Eban sought wasn&rsquo;t the same as Zarik; in Eban&rsquo;s heart of hearts, distrust of all shadowed his reasoning and mayhaps he merely wished to grasp the secrets of the locket. To B, Eban was more than just a seedy thief – he was B&rsquo;s wet dream!</p><p>Hence B devised the contagion of devious favoritism, firing Zarik with dreams to appease his hunger; the trap had been set and tongues had begun to wag.</p><p>In a game of dare between Eban and Zarik, both set sail from the harbor of their delusions. As if stirred by B&rsquo;s deceitful hum, the hungry winds welcomed this competition of eggs with abattoir walls. Zarik, curious and quite ignorant of Eban&rsquo;s greed-filled soul, had set sail for the treasures in the land of uncharted dreams, while Eban followed the symptomatic flutter of the sails.</p><p>As B orchestrated the dance between Zarik and Eban to embrace the limits of the future, the winds of time became unpredictable, accelerating in a frenzy to fulfill the ancient, existential privilege of B, the Phantom of Gpreciu. The storm of time wrapped around Eban&rsquo;s ship, taking him into the abysmal void. Zariq had just scraped off the invisible ink left by B&rsquo;s fate-spinning speculations.</p><p>The Enigma was truly free from the locket. The misinterpreted ripples of time had evaded Eban&rsquo;s short, terrible blindness. For all Eban&rsquo;s cunning knowledge of maritime skills, he failed to fathom the complexity of a temporal storm. The mystery dissolved, but Eban knew no humility. His actions, though seemingly random, appeared mighty in external reality, leaving the shores of Gpreciu vastly unaffected and untouched.</p><p>The locket, free of its secrets, fell open to reveal spectral and spectral verse, a prose of ethereal beauty and intellect. Zarik, mirroring B&rsquo;s predicament, had no way of knowing what reality had become. He embarked upon the dark precipice of wrapping his appeal as an &ldquo;unmistakable enigma.&rdquo;</p><p>As Zarik ascended in his proficiency, the captured future waned; B envisaged the separation, the twofold payment of his interference in the illusion-infested realm.</p><p>&ldquo;Magic and mischief,&rdquo; B whispered to the evening air. &ldquo;The Enigma&rsquo;s treasure was never meant for me, or for them. I am but a specter, a stranger, trembling in the seeming race of these two sheep in wolf teeth. Isn&rsquo;t it funny, how intelligence accepts the obvious and misses the glances that escape the obvious?&rdquo;</p><p>B peered deep within his silver blind, seeing by touch the whipping leaves of the locket, the secret ledger. He had seen all that was there to see – all, except the last revelation, the grand finale – the eventual overbearing fuse to free the wraps around the locket&rsquo;s secrets.</p><p>Eban&rsquo;s greed, having led him to his doom, was B&rsquo;s small payment for his magic and mischief. As Eban disappeared into the dark hungry waves, the phantom&rsquo;s treasure was divulged.</p><p>The only task that was left was to break the enchantment that had built up over the locket of secrets; B knew it was a safe bet to place the blame on Eban. The phantasmic specter had made quite the extravagant bet with time.</p><p>For all of B&rsquo;s wisdom, cunning, and power to weave intricately, it was by Eban&rsquo;s downfall and the wounds left by the phantom&rsquo;s self-inflicted blindness that the last, great secret emerged. One day, Eban&rsquo;s disappearance would write about B&rsquo;s sway over time.</p><p>With this in mind, B sutures the vast escape and retreats, not deceiving himself into feeling glorious about his exploits, but lovingly aware of the ebbing waves of conscience. The wistful midnight story of B continues to mutate in an ever-changing world.</p><p>In an ever-illuminating loop of existence, the phantom treasure lies dormant and vampiric, listening to its sanguinary echoes. Time flickers again, with B at the helm – for, finally becoming sighted in the Enigma, B sought to unveil to the world his treasure, the locket that served as the key and potential demise to many.</p><p>But B knew he would be its destroyer last – for as with all treasure, the real gemstones are the lessons, woven beautiful and dread between the fate-complex of traitors, cheats, and those who believe in the illusion of infinity.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/hidden-treasures/>Hidden Treasures</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-mystery-of-the-sapphire-key-a-hidden-treasure-tale/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Mystery of the Sapphire Key: A Hidden Treasure Tale</span>
