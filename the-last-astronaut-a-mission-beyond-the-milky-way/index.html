The once-thriving cosmos was now a barren expanse, devoid of life and energy. The Great Collapse, a cataclysmic event that had ravaged the galaxy, had left him the sole survivor.
The silence was deafening. Harris's thoughts drifted back to the events that had led him to this moment. The warnings, the pleas for caution, and the dire predictions – all ignored, or so it seemed. The galaxy's downfall had been a gradual process, with the first hints of disaster emerging decades ago. The initial tremors, the minor earthquakes, had served as a harbinger of the cataclysm to come.
As the last astronaut, Harris had been given a second chance to explore the unknown, to seek out the secrets of the cosmos, and perhaps find a way to rekindle the light of life in the galaxy. His mission, codenamed "Elysium," had taken him to the farthest reaches of the galaxy, and beyond.
Act I: The Journey Begins
The Aurora, a marvel of engineering, had been Harris's home for the past two years. Equipped with state-of-the-art technology, the ship was designed for one purpose: to transcend the boundaries of space and time. Harris's destination was the uncharted expanse, known as the Inter-Galactic Medium (IGM). A vast, radiation-filled region, the IGM held secrets of the universe's creation and the mysteries of dark matter.
As Aurora pierced through the dernoisel shell, a cosmic barrier formed by the remnants of stars, Harris felt a shiver run down his spine. The environment within the IGM was unforgiving, with radiation levels exceeding those near a neutron star. However, the ship's advanced shielding and Harris's own suit insured his survival.
Act II: The First Encounter
As the Aurora navigated the labyrinthine pathways of the IGM, Harris began to detect faint, anomalous readings. Signals from unknown sources, akin to cosmic whispers, hinted at the presence of life beyond the galaxy. The prospect of encountering another civilization sparked both excitement and trepidation within Harris.
Suddenly, Aurora 's sensors picked up a mass of singular density, a primeval nebula, in the vicinity. Harris's fingers moved swiftly across the control panel, adjusting the ship's trajectory to intercept the nebula. The fascinating mass that he had encountered slowly took shape before him.
Peering through the window, Harris beheld an enigmatic, crystalline structure. Stretching millions of kilometers across, the crystalline mass possessed luminescent properties, while radiating extraordinary degrees of gravitational force. Harris realized that this must be a primordial remnant of the universe's early era.
Act III: The Crystal Core
Drawing closer to the crystalline mass, Harris detected an curious fluctuations emanating from it. A higher energy output, he hypothesized, was linked to the First (or Big Bang).
