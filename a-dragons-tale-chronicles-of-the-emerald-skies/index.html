Terros, a magnificent Primal Dragon, possessed a heart of pure gold and wings that sparkled like the very stars. He cast a spectacular shadow against the vibrant green heavens, darker than the abyss below yet radiant as the eternal sun above.</p><p>As the eldest of his kin, Terros embraced both great power and sacred responsibility. Every day, he would ascend from the hidden valley of Rhomos, nestled deep within the Fae&rsquo;aren woods, to the glimmering Dragon Altar on the peak of Mount Pyroshock. Here, he paid homage to the ancestors and offered virgin flames from the sacred lava pool for the nourishment and fortitude of his kin.</p><p>Yet, despite his nobleness and power, the other dragons held a deep universally admired fear for Terros. This supernatural dread arose not from his intimidating ferocity but from a cryptic prophecy whispered through the ages. The ancients believed that one day, Terros would face a calamity that would either tear the bond between the dragons and their beloved Windrider apart or grant Terros a wisdom that transcended even the most innovative mages of Lunara.</p><p>That fateful day arrived sooner than they had deemed possible. As flames flickered across the fabled Nestervale, a war unlike any other was upon the realm. Drakoon, an anguished and tormented sibling of ancient times, had returned from the depths of malevolence to seek revenge, wielding a rose of frost upon which bitterness and disaster cavorted deviously. A battle between sorrow and fury ignited, and the skies over Draconi birthed a tempest that changed the fate of its denizens forever.</p><p>Terros soared into the chaos, fiery determination pounding in his heart. He knew Drakoon&rsquo;s lust for destruction was insatiable, hungering for the annihilation of everything his kin held cherished. Dread unfolded in stages, frost biting the vitality from the air of Draconi&rsquo;s skies. Terros, however, refused to yield and, in defiance, unleashed the molten blaze of his own heart.</p><p>Fragrant with newly poured lava and acute as dragon&rsquo;s fire, the clash of forces erupted in a tempest of smoke and flame. Grappling victoriously in the skies, their talons entwined and fangs gnashing, the brothers pummeled each other with unrivaled force. Yet as their fiery fury escalated, another element of this celestial calamity emerged: the corruption of the emerald skies by Drakoon&rsquo;s frozen malice.</p><p>Billowing clouds of thick, emerald fog surged, blinding both adversaries. Drakoon saw an opening and with malicious gloom, wielded the rose upon Terros with chilling precision. The wound seared like no other, its pain so intense it seemed as if countless dungeons of ice hollowed out Terros&rsquo; heart.</p><p>Dragons fell, their wings faltering, gasping for the poisoned air. Terrified screams from their brothers and sisters, the echoes of their cries, shuddering through the essence of Draconi. Later, it would become known as the Second Fall of the Silver Hearts, as many brave dragons would perish that day in the execution of their duty.</p><p>Terros struggled, desperately tearing his heart from the grip of the frost and rose, using his own blood and anguish to command a change in the tempestuous dance. He called forth a hidden ally, the Silver Wind, an ethereal power only Terros had ever dared to summon: It is through the wind that the vastness of Draconi communicates. Shedding the last vestiges of pain and illness, the Silver Wind raced through Draconi&rsquo;s skies, pushing back the mass of cold that sought to suffocate it.</p><p>The battle claimed the lives of many but finally reached its zenith. A triumphant, intoxicating heat gave birth to a breath. Terros pulled from the very depths of his compassion, surrendering to the love he had for his kin, for the harmony once held sacred between dragons and the wind. Warmth gushed from his chest, fusing with the Silver Wind to cleanse Draconi&rsquo;s skies.</p><p>As the air cleared, a transcendental and ineffable aura took flight, encapsulating the miserable victory. Two dragons, once entwined in the coils of malevolence and anguish, parted ways for the last time, Drakoon sinking into the abyssal blackness below.</p><p>The truth unveiled itself amidst the silence: the esteemed Windrider, Terros, the mighty dragon whose very soul inspired and nurtured the sacred harmony of the skies, suffered a wound beyond the reach of immortal fire, submitting to the prolonged silence of eternal slumber. It would be the regret of his own kind.</p><p>Following Terros&rsquo; passing, Draconi&rsquo;s skies shed their emerald hue, becoming an aftermath of dulled cobalt. The ancient bond between dragons and the wind, once vibrant and resonant, grew somber and thin. A new era dawned, silent, and heavy as the night. Yet, the wind whispered a final lament for Terros, about whom tales would be spun in hallowed echoes from one millennia to the next.</p><p>Kindred bound in a treasured dance, the Silver Wind carried the warmth of immortal flame in remembrance of Terros, spiraling ever upward, defying the darkened skies above. The immortal lullaby of the Silver Wind sailed southward over the unyielding black sands of the forgotten dunes, into the realm of legend and myth.</p><p>And he shall ascend no more; yet, the bards say that in the quietude of the moon&rsquo;s tender touch on Draconi&rsquo;s tear-filled zenith, Terros can be seen: once more soaring freeamongst the winds.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/fantasy-worlds/>Fantasy Worlds</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/a-dance-with-the-elementals/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>A Dance with the Elementals</span>
