The once bustling streets were now empty, save for the few scattered remnants of a civilization that was on the brink of extinction. The colony's leader, Councilor Elara Vex, stood at the edge of a hill overlooking the settlement, her eyes fixed on the horizon.
Kyrios-IV was a planet ravaged by war and environmental disasters. The once thriving ecosystem had been decimated, leaving behind a barren wasteland that stretched as far as the eye could see. The colony's air was thick with the acrid smell of smoke and ash, and the only sound was the gentle hum of the life-support systems that kept the last of humanity alive.
"We can't keep relying on the Hab's barely functional life-support systems," warned Dr. Maya Singh, the colony's chief engineer, as she approached Councilor Vex. "It's only a matter of time before the CO2 levels and temperature fluctuations become unbearable."
"Our people are counting on us to keep them safe," Councilor Vex replied, her voice laced with worry. "But at what cost? The Derwent crew may have provided us with supplies and aid, but it's clear they're preparing to abandon ship. We need to keep it together, for our people's sake."
"We're running low on resources, Councilor," Dr. Singh warned, as she checked the remaining water and food allotment statistics on her personal comms module. "A few days at most before we have to ration distribution strictly. The decks may be stacked against us, but someone needs to speak out."
"Dr. Singh, I've already ordered limited production from our renewables to support water and food harvesting," the Councilor retorted before heading towards the Administration Core.
Councilor Vex took her position at the viewscreen and studied the landscape unfolding before her.
She leaned forward on her personal comms board.
"Bridge. I have a question.
We're dependent on the resources support from the Derwent. That medical team standing by to pitch in with medical aid?" Elara looked around at her local community so conscious in fragility, woven as fragile gills to a failure.
"Your request."
"In view of ongoing resource limitations from no financial aid redistribution policy exists beyond colony exclusivity? What disposition can this planet reach considering economy monarchive misallocation?"
