A cool breeze rustled the leaves, sending crimson and gold spirals tumbling along the cobblestone streets. Jack-o’-lanterns flickered on every porch, their glowing faces casting playful shadows on the old, weathered homes. The air smelled of cider, caramel, and the faint smoke of burning wood, marking the start of Halloween night.</p><p>Thirteen-year-old Ellie Monroe tugged her mask into place—a black cat, complete with pointed ears and whisker marks painted across her cheeks—before joining her friends. Finn, dressed as a lumberjack with a plastic axe slung over his shoulder, gave her a toothy grin, while Nora adjusted her ghostly white bedsheet costume.</p><p>&ldquo;Ready for the candy haul of the century?&rdquo; Finn asked, holding up his pillowcase, already stitched at the seams from years of hard use.</p><p>Ellie laughed. &ldquo;You bet. But this year, let’s try something different. I heard about Hollow Grove.&rdquo;</p><p>Nora froze. &ldquo;You mean those woods at the edge of town? The ones people say are cursed?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Legend says cursed,&rdquo; Ellie corrected dramatically, wiggling her fingers. &ldquo;But it’s just that: a legend. I overheard the older kids say there’s a house deep in the grove where they hand out full-size candy bars. King-sized.&rdquo;</p><p>Finn’s eyes widened. &ldquo;King-sized? No way.&rdquo;</p><p>Nora frowned, gripping her pumpkin pail tight enough to turn her knuckles white. &ldquo;Ellie, are you sure it’s safe? Curses aside, Hollow Grove has no streetlights. It’s pitch dark out there.&rdquo;</p><p>Ellie crossed her arms. &ldquo;What’s Halloween without a little adventure? C’mon, it’ll be fun. And think of all the candy we’ll get! If we don’t find the house, we’ll just head back to town. Promise.&rdquo;</p><p>After a moment of hesitation, Nora sighed. &ldquo;Fine. But if something bad happens, it’s on you.&rdquo;</p><p>The trio set off toward the outskirts of town, their costumes blending into the sea of witches, superheroes, vampires, and pirates that roamed the streets. They passed by homes decked out with cotton spiderwebs, inflatable skeletons, and animatronic ghouls that cackled as they marched by. The sound of children laughing and calling out &ldquo;trick-or-treat&rdquo; filled the autumn air.</p><hr><p>The road to Hollow Grove was quieter, the festive sounds fading into the distance behind them. Crunching leaves underfoot were the only noise as the trio approached the forest. Tall, gnarled trees loomed overhead like skeletal sentinels, their branches knotted together in a canopy that blocked out the moonlight. A wooden sign hung crookedly at the entrance to the grove. Faded letters spelled out &ldquo;Hollow Grove - Enter at Your Own Risk.&rdquo;</p><p>Finn inspected it. &ldquo;That’s&mldr; charming.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ignore it,&rdquo; Ellie said, her voice steady though her heartbeat picked up. She pulled out a flashlight, its narrow beam cutting through the darkness ahead. &ldquo;Let’s go.&rdquo;</p><p>They ventured into the woods, their footsteps muffled by a carpet of damp leaves. The cold seemed sharper here. Each breath came out in a small cloud of fog. The deeper they went, the quieter the world became. No wind stirred the trees. No crickets chirped. It was as though the night itself was holding its breath.</p><p>&ldquo;I don’t like this,&rdquo; Nora whispered.</p><p>&ldquo;You’re letting your imagination get to you,&rdquo; Ellie reassured, though she turned to make sure they were still on the trail. &ldquo;We’re almost there. I can feel it.&rdquo;</p><p>Minutes stretched into what felt like hours before something caught Finn’s eye. &ldquo;Is that&mldr; a lantern?&rdquo;</p><p>Ellie turned her flashlight in the direction he pointed, and sure enough, a faint, warm glow flickered through the trees. Excitement bubbled in her chest. &ldquo;It’s gotta be the house!&rdquo;</p><p>The faint glow guided them, growing brighter as they approached. The flashlight fell dim by comparison when they finally stepped into a clearing. There, standing tall against the dark sky, was the house. Its weathered, Victorian-style architecture oozed mystery. The windows were lit with golden light, and a carved pumpkin grinned wickedly on the porch. A crooked wooden sign stuck in the yard read &ldquo;Trick-or-Treaters Welcome.&rdquo;</p><p>Finn whistled. &ldquo;Looks legit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I told you,&rdquo; Ellie said, triumph gleaming in her voice. &ldquo;Come on, let’s knock.&rdquo;</p><p>The wooden steps creaked under their weight as they ascended the porch. Ellie hesitated before the door, its black paint peeling like snakeskin. She raised her hand and knocked three times.</p><p>The door creaked open on its own.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, okay,&rdquo; Nora said, gripping Ellie’s sleeve. &ldquo;Maybe let’s not go inside?&rdquo;</p><p>But Ellie was already stepping through the threshold. She glanced back. &ldquo;It’s fine. Look, the candy bowl’s right there.&rdquo; She pointed to a table in the center of the room, where a large crystal bowl overflowed with candy bars that shimmered enticingly in the warm light.</p><p>Finn followed her inside, followed by a very reluctant Nora. As they stepped into the room, the door slammed shut with a loud <em>bang</em>.</p><p>&ldquo;That’s not a good sign,&rdquo; Finn muttered.</p><p>Ellie turned to the door and tried the knob, but it wouldn’t budge. Panic flared in Nora’s wide eyes. &ldquo;What do we do now?&rdquo;</p><p>Before Ellie could reply, the light in the room flickered and then extinguished. The trio froze in the sudden darkness. A low, chilling laugh echoed from somewhere above them.</p><p>&ldquo;You’ve come to play,&rdquo; a voice rasped.</p><p>Ellie’s flashlight flickered to life again, its beam catching swirling motes of dust in what looked like an abandoned parlor. The furniture was draped in white sheets, cobwebs stretched across the corners of the ceiling, and the ornate crystal bowl that had held the candy was nowhere to be found. Instead, on the table, sat an old, tattered book.</p><p>Ellie stepped forward, drawn to it almost instinctively. Written in looping, elegant script on the cover were the words <em>The Halloween Trials</em>. She opened it, revealing a page scrawled with instructions:</p><p><em>Welcome to the Halloween Trials. Three trials for three trick-or-treaters. Only those who complete the trials will earn their freedom&mldr; and their candy.</em></p><p>Nora whimpered. Finn’s jaw dropped. Ellie felt her pulse thunder in her ears but was determined to remain calm. &ldquo;It’s just some elaborate prank,&rdquo; she said, though her voice betrayed her uncertainty.</p><p>&ldquo;Look, the first trial is listed right here.&rdquo; She pointed to the page. It read:</p><p><em>&ldquo;Trial One: Brave the Labyrinth of Shadows. Find the key that unlocks the gate.&rdquo;</em></p><p>Before anyone could question what it meant, the floor under them trembled, and the room seemed to dissolve into swirling smoke. When the smoke cleared, they were no longer in the parlor but standing at the entrance to a towering hedge maze. At the center rose a foreboding iron gate, its keyhole glinting like a hungry eye.</p><p>&ldquo;This&mldr; feels a lot less like a prank,&rdquo; Finn whispered.</p><p>Ellie took a deep breath and squared her shoulders. &ldquo;We stick together. Just keep moving forward.&rdquo;</p><p>They entered the maze, the paths dark and twisting, flanked by hedges that seemed to reach out with claw-like branches. Strange whispers drifted on the wind, voices faint but insistent: &ldquo;Turn back&mldr; You’re not welcome here&mldr;&rdquo;</p><p>The group clung to each other as they navigated the maze, turning corner after corner, until they stumbled upon a small clearing. A pedestal sat in the center, and on it lay a jagged, rusted key.</p><p>Ellie grabbed it. The moment she did, the whispers grew into an ear-shattering shriek, and the hedges seemed to close in around them. Finn shouted, &ldquo;Run!&rdquo;</p><p>They tore through the maze, the narrow beam of Ellie’s flashlight their only guide. The branches ripped at their costumes as the maze twisted unnaturally, but finally, they burst through to the iron gate. Ellie jammed the key into the lock and turned it. The gate creaked open, and the maze dissolved into mist.</p><p>The book reappeared in Ellie’s hands, its pages flipping to reveal the second trial.</p><p><em>&ldquo;Trial Two: The Residents of the House. Seek their approval, or face their wrath.&rdquo;</em></p><p>The trio looked at one another, their breaths uneven as the laughter from earlier echoed again. Whatever lay ahead, they had no choice but to face it.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/festivals-and-celebrations/>Festivals and Celebrations</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/halloween-mysteries-ghosts-ghouls-and-the-spirit-of-fun/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Halloween Mysteries: Ghosts, Ghouls, and the Spirit of Fun</span>
