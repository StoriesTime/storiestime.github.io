Below, the valley stretched for miles, its once-lush greenery now singed to ash, smothered under the wrath of fire-laden skies. The scent of charred timber and scorched earth filled her lungs, a reminder of the devastation her people had endured. Somewhere beyond the horizon, the shadow of her former ally darkened the sky. The dragon, Aelthirion, had broken his vow.</p><p>There had been a time when dragon and human had worked in harmony. Centuries ago, a pact had been forged: the Great Accord. Aelthirion, the last of his kind, had sworn to protect the realm, serving as its guardian against all threats—be they from neighboring kingdoms or ambitions born close to home. Bound by his promise to the first queen of Eldris, the dragon had upheld peace for two hundred years. But promises, as Amara had learned, could be fragile things.</p><p>Amara pulled her dagger from its sheath, her fingers running over the engraved words on the hilt. &ldquo;Fire binds,&rdquo; it read, an echo of the Great Accord&rsquo;s creed. It was the only thing she had left of her family, her lineage. As the last heir of Eldris, her duty was clear: she would confront Aelthirion, even if it meant her end. The dragon had betrayed their trust, turned on those he had vowed to protect. For reasons unknown, he now waged war, raining fire upon the realm he once safeguarded.</p><p>A growl in the distance pulled her from her thoughts. Amara turned, her sharp eyes scanning the horizon. The wind carried with it the unmistakable heat of a dragon approaching, the very air charged with his presence. The sun dipped lower, bathing the world in amber hues, as an ominous shadow crept across the valley.</p><p>It was him.</p><p>Aelthirion emerged from the clouds, his enormous wings slicing through the heavens with unparalleled grace. His dark, glistening scales mirrored the sunset, each one a shard of obsidian, shimmering and foreboding. His molten iron eyes locked onto her as he landed with a thunderous quake atop the ridge, the earth trembling beneath his weight.</p><p>&ldquo;Amara of Eldris,&rdquo; his voice rumbled like a volcano stirring to life, deep and resonant. &ldquo;You bear the dagger of Olaris.&rdquo; His gaze lingered on the weapon in her hand. &ldquo;Do you intend to kill me with it?&rdquo;</p><p>Amara stepped closer, keeping her composure despite the fear coursing through her veins. &ldquo;I intend to remind you of the promise you made to my ancestors, Aelthirion!&rdquo; she shouted above the roaring wind. &ldquo;You vowed to protect Eldris. You swore an oath!&rdquo;</p><p>The dragon&rsquo;s nostrils flared, releasing plumes of ash-laden breath. &ldquo;A vow?&rdquo; His tone was laced with bitterness, as if the word itself had become a curse. &ldquo;An oath made under false pretenses is hardly binding.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Amara&rsquo;s voice wavered, though she pressed on. &ldquo;The Accord was borne of trust. It kept the realm safe&mldr; until you turned on us.&rdquo;</p><p>Aelthirion lowered his massive head, his golden eyes now level with hers. &ldquo;Do you truly believe the Accord was for your benefit? That it was I who needed your people’s protection?&rdquo; His words dripped with scorn. &ldquo;The truth, child, is that your ancestors sought to leash me with their promises. They feared my power, and so they hid their ambition behind acts of false charity, of so-called partnership. And now, here you stand, dagger in hand, ready to do what they could not. The hypocrisy is almost amusing.&rdquo;</p><p>Amara faltered, her grip tightening on the blade. The history she had been taught spoke only of peace—a fragile one at times, but peace nonetheless. Her ancestors had painted Aelthirion as a savior, a protector. Could it be possible that they had manipulated him instead, exploiting his strength to assert their control?</p><p>&ldquo;Even if you speak the truth,&rdquo; Amara said, steadying her voice, &ldquo;what does that justify? These past weeks, you&rsquo;ve ravaged the land. You’ve slaughtered innocents who had done you no harm. Do you think vengeance will bring you peace?&rdquo;</p><p>The dragon raised his massive wings, casting a shadow over her. &ldquo;Peace,&rdquo; he rumbled, &ldquo;is an illusion crafted by the weak to veil the truth. For two centuries, I have endured your people&rsquo;s demands, their prying eyes, their chains cloaked beneath words of friendship. No more. I have shattered the illusion. Let those who survive rebuild in fire’s wake, unshackled by deceit.&rdquo;</p><p>Amara felt anger boiling within her. &ldquo;And what of those who cannot rebuild? What of the farmers, the travelers, the children? You claim to abhor deceit, yet you lay waste to the innocent! How are you any better than the ones who deceived you?&rdquo;</p><p>The question seemed to strike a nerve. Aelthirion recoiled slightly, his eyes narrowing. The massive beast let out a low growl. For the first time, Amara thought she saw something other than fury within him—something akin to pain.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you think I take pleasure in this?&rdquo; he thundered. &ldquo;Do you think fire and fury come without a price? I am alone, Amara. Alone in a world that fears me, mistrusts me, and seeks always to twist my power to its will. Every bond I’ve known has been one of betrayal.&rdquo; His voice softened, though it still held an edge. &ldquo;Even you… even now, you carry that blade made to pierce my heart.&rdquo;</p><p>Amara hesitated, her thoughts swirling. Aelthirion’s isolation resonated with her. She too had lost everyone she loved to violence—violence that began the moment the dragon betrayed them. Or had it been violence that her ancestors had sown and left for her to reap? The lines between right and wrong blurred, like embers shifting in the wind.</p><p>She lowered the dagger slightly, though she did not relinquish it entirely. &ldquo;If you seek to destroy the chains of the past,&rdquo; she said carefully, &ldquo;then let us end this in a way that leaves the realm alive to see it. Prove to me that you are more than the monster you’ve become.&rdquo;</p><p>Aelthirion studied her for a long moment. The tension in the air was suffocating, the silence broken only by the rustle of his wings and the crackle of distant fires. Finally, he spoke.</p><p>&ldquo;You would stand against the legacy of your forebears? You would risk the ire of those who would call me a traitor, a beast, were I to lay down my wrath?&rdquo;</p><p>She sheathed the dagger, meeting his gaze with unwavering resolve. &ldquo;I would… if only to prove the past does not have to define us.&rdquo;</p><p>The dragon exhaled, a sound heavy with years of pain and fury, as though releasing the weight he had carried for so long. &ldquo;Perhaps, then, we are not so different,&rdquo; Aelthirion murmured, his wings lowering. &ldquo;But understand, Amara of Eldris, this is not forgiveness. My fire may sleep… but I am still a creature of it.&rdquo;</p><p>Amara nodded, unsure whether she had forged a new alliance or simply delayed her death. Still, a flicker of hope ignited within her—a spark amidst the ashes—that perhaps fire and fury could give way, at last, to something brighter.</p><p>As she followed the massive shadow down into the valley, she wondered whether this fragile, uncertain accord could be something more. Whether, in the end, even the most broken promises could be mended.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/mystical-creatures/>Mystical Creatures</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/a-chupacabras-misunderstood-crusade/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>A Chupacabra's Misunderstood Crusade</span>
