Jonas Mellor stood at the edge of the shimmering gateway, its circular frame pulsing with faint blue light. He’d spent years trying to figure out if he should take this leap, but even now, seconds before committing, his heart warred with his mind.</p><p>Behind him, the room was dark—industrial, utilitarian. The kind of laboratory that told you it didn’t care about aesthetics so long as it served its purpose. Cables snaked across the concrete floor, and monitors flickered with chaotic streams of data Jonas barely understood anymore. The most advanced technology in the world surrounded him, and yet he felt primitive, no smarter than a caveman holding fire for the first time.</p><p>Jonas wasn’t the scientist who invented the portal. That honor belonged to his mentor, Dr. Elise Carmichael. But he was the one who uncovered its true potential. Time travel wasn’t just theoretical anymore; it was real, tangible, and terrifying.</p><p>The Paradox Portal, as everyone in the project dubbed it, didn’t operate on simple physics. It didn’t just bend time—it twisted logic, tangled events, and crumpled cause-and-effect into labyrinths no human mind could fully comprehend. Every simulation they’d run promised consequences, unforeseen cascades that rippled far beyond any traveler’s intent. But Jonas wasn’t here to run simulations anymore. He was here for answers.</p><p>The lab felt empty without Elise. Jonas glanced at the dusty desk in the corner of the room, where an old photo of him and Elise still sat in a cracked frame. They had been close—closer than they’d admitted out loud—but that was before she disappeared. Gone without a trace after activating the portal herself six months ago. No messages, no remnants. Just the hum of the machine she had perfected.</p><p>Jonas clenched his fists. Six months of scouring her notes, retracing her theories, and wildly speculating had led him here: the decision to cross. He could let the world tell him to move on; Elise might never return. Or he could defy every caution in his soul and step into the unknown.</p><p>The decision was screamingly clear. Jonas grabbed the tethered power pack from the workstation and attached it to his belt. The pack would supply just enough energy to ensure the return trip, but even that wasn’t guaranteed. Nothing about this journey was. He fastened the terminal node to his wrist, syncing it to the suit’s sensors. The lights on the node blinked in unison, syncing to the portal’s rhythm.</p><p>He took one last look at the room.</p><p>&ldquo;Goodbye,&rdquo; he muttered to no one, and stepped forward.</p><hr><p>The sensation of crossing the portal was all-consuming, like being pulled through water that weighed nothing but pressed against everything. Jonas couldn’t breathe, couldn’t even think, as time and space folded around him. Images flickered in the corners of his vision—shards of memory, glimpses of possibilities he couldn’t grasp—but they were gone as quickly as they appeared.</p><p>Then, silence. As suddenly as the chaos began, it ended, and Jonas found himself on solid ground.</p><p>The landscape around him was unrecognizable. A sprawling city stretched before him, but its architecture was unlike anything he had ever seen. Towers twisted unnaturally into the sky, glowing with colors that didn’t exist in his era. The air felt thick with energy, and strange vehicles glided noiselessly through the streets, powered by some unseen force.</p><p>Jonas glanced at his wrist node. The timestamps confirmed it—he was five hundred years into the future.</p><p>He had rehearsed this moment countless times, imagining the awe he’d feel seeing the future&rsquo;s marvels. Yet awe wasn’t the dominant emotion gripping him now. A cold chill seeped into his gut, an instinctive fear he couldn’t explain. Something was wrong.</p><p>He wandered through the streets, overwhelmed by the sheer alienness of it all. People moved around him, their clothing sleek and functional, their faces serene. Yet they seemed oddly focused, walking with purpose and rarely speaking. Jonas felt invisible among them, yet he knew they could see him. Occasionally, a passerby would glance in his direction, their expression shifting briefly to confusion before returning to calm neutrality.</p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; Jonas called out to a woman nearby. She froze mid-stride, turning toward him with wide, startled eyes. He could see her scanning him, her gaze darting to the outdated material of his suit.</p><p>&ldquo;You’re… not supposed to be here,&rdquo; she said, her voice low and strangely rehearsed.</p><p>Jonas felt his pulse quicken. &ldquo;I know. I’m not from here. I need help. I’m looking for Elise Carmichael. She came through—&rdquo;</p><p>The woman took a step back. &ldquo;You shouldn’t say her name.&rdquo;</p><p>Jonas stopped cold. &ldquo;What? Why?&rdquo;</p><p>Before she could answer, another figure approached—a man wearing an identical suit to hers. Jonas hadn&rsquo;t seen him until now, but his presence was intimidating without being overtly aggressive.</p><p>&ldquo;Come with us,&rdquo; the man commanded.</p><p>&ldquo;And if I don’t?&rdquo; Jonas asked, keeping his distance.</p><p>&ldquo;Then you’ll become part of the paradox.&rdquo;</p><hr><p>Jonas was ushered into a building resembling a crystalline fortress. Inside, he was confronted by screens displaying fragments of history, timelines branching like tangled vines. His instincts screamed to run, but the sight of Elise’s face frozen on one monitor drew him deeper.</p><p>&ldquo;What is this place?&rdquo; Jonas asked, his voice steadied by desperation.</p><p>The woman from earlier stepped forward and gestured toward the screens. &ldquo;This is the Nexus. The repository for corrections. And Elise Carmichael is at the center of it.&rdquo;</p><p>Jonas froze. &ldquo;She’s alive?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Alive, but she’s fractured,&rdquo; the man answered. &ldquo;Your Elise triggered a localized convergence when she entered the paradox. She’s no longer one person. She exists across dimensions, split into shards that ripple through the Nexus.&rdquo;</p><p>Jonas felt as though the floor had vanished beneath him. &ldquo;I can bring her back.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You can’t,&rdquo; they said in unison.</p><p>Jonas’s grip tightened on the node at his wrist. &ldquo;Try stopping me.&rdquo;</p><hr><p>Deeper into the Nexus he slipped, defying the rules to uncover Elise&rsquo;s presence. Each screen, each thread of history, each disturbing ripple brought him closer to the truth: that Elise’s experiment wasn’t just an accident—it was intentional.</p><p>Finally, he found her in a mirrored chamber where her fractured selves swirled in light and shadow. She looked at him—not one version of her, but every version. Her voice was layered, haunting and beautiful.</p><p>&ldquo;You shouldn’t have followed me, Jonas.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You left me,&rdquo; Jonas said, his voice breaking. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because some answers destroy more than they heal.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not for me,&rdquo; Jonas pleaded. &ldquo;Come back.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You’d undo the things I’ve seen—the paradoxes I’ve become. Would you risk unmaking everything for me?&rdquo; she asked softly.</p><p>Jonas stepped closer. Finally, he understood: The portal wasn’t built to change time. It was built to reveal its fractured truth.</p><p>And its price was unbearable.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/time-travel-and-alternate-realities/>Time Travel and Alternate Realities</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-paradox-pawsome-time-traveling-trials/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Paradox Pawsome: Time Traveling Trials</span>
