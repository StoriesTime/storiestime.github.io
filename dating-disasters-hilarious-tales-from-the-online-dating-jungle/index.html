They’d endured enough semi-tearful brunches filled with waffle crumbs and existential dread to know she wasn’t going to do it herself. Enter the creation of her dating profile, a collaborative effort fueled by half-priced margaritas and an overabundance of confidence.</p><p>“Non-negotiables!” her best friend Lisa had declared while typing furiously into Charlotte’s barely-used phone. “You need to list those. Men need to know where to draw the line.”</p><p>“Um,” Charlotte stammered, twirling a strand of chestnut hair. “I don’t like eggplant.”</p><p>Lisa paused. “Eggplant is a vegetable, Charlotte, not a dealbreaker.”</p><p>Thus began her foray into the labyrinth we know as online dating—a peculiar and occasionally horrifying territory where first impressions are forged in emojis and love stories crumble under grammar errors in the second sentence.</p><hr><h2 id=date-1-the-literary-disaster>Date #1: The Literary Disaster</h2><p>The first contender was Carl. He was a freelance writer who messaged her using a Jane Austen quote, which Charlotte found endearing—until the actual date.</p><p>“You don’t like Austen?” Carl asked over their appetizers. His face twisted into a mix of shock and sheer disappointment. “But that’s… how? What books have influenced your worldview if not <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>?”</p><p>Charlotte nervously stabbed at her salad. “Well, I mean, I love fantasy novels—mainly because they—”</p><p>“Fantasy?” He nearly choked. “You mean… dragons and elves and that sort of nonsense?”</p><p>“Not… nonsense,” Charlotte said carefully. “I think Tolkien is—”</p><p>Carl threw up his hands. “Tolkien?! Tolkien is the literary equivalent of fast food for your brain!”</p><p>By the time the check arrived, Charlotte could barely look at him without feeling like her hobbies had been crushed under the weight of his superiority complex. Her friends insisted that she swipe right again, proclaiming, “Hey, we still have ninety-nine more fish in the sea to try.”</p><hr><h2 id=date-2-the-self-proclaimed-inventor>Date #2: The Self-Proclaimed Inventor</h2><p>Enter Greg. Greg’s profile claimed he was an innovator, a trailblazer in tech. Naturally, Charlotte was curious, imagining some sort of young Tony Stark. But ten minutes into their meeting at a coffee shop, it became apparent that Greg’s “inventions” were&mldr; shall we say, unconventional?</p><p>“You know napkins?” Greg leaned over the table dramatically. “I’m creating premium, reusable napkins called <em>Forever Towels.</em> It’ll revolutionize dining forever.”</p><p>Charlotte blinked. “…Aren’t reusable napkins just regular fabric napkins?”</p><p>His face grew solemn, as if she had just insulted his child. “No. Think bigger. Mine come with a downloadable app that tracks your usage patterns. Data is the future.”</p><p>The final straw came when Greg attempted to sketch the napkin app’s interface on the back of her Starbucks receipt while loudly proclaiming, “One day, people will call me the Elon Musk of table settings.”</p><p>As Charlotte fled through the revolving door, she vowed to never again go on a date with anyone who described themselves as “visionary” in their bio.</p><hr><h2 id=date-3-the-overachiever>Date #3: The Overachiever</h2><p>Two weeks later, she met Hannah. Hannah was, by far, the most impressive person Charlotte had dated—an accomplished architect-turned-painter who balanced marathons, charity work, and gourmet cooking as easily as most people breathed.</p><p>Except Hannah didn’t just balance her own life; she felt compelled to optimize everyone else’s.</p><p>“You’re ordering fries with your sandwich?” Hannah asked, incredulous. “Aren’t you worried about your cholesterol?”</p><p>But it didn’t stop there. The spin class, the productivity apps, the bizarre bedtime schedule that involved “recharging chakras” with crystals—every moment with Hannah seemed like a pitch to join her relentless pursuit of self-optimization.</p><p>By the end of their second (and final) date, Charlotte began to seriously consider the benefits of being single forever. At least her couch didn’t judge her for eating French fries.</p><hr><h2 id=date-4-the-mysterious-catfish>Date #4: The Mysterious Catfish</h2><p>Then there was Brandon. Oh, Brandon.</p><p>Brandon’s profile showed a rugged, bearded man with piercing blue eyes and an affinity for hiking. They messaged back and forth for weeks before Charlotte agreed to meet him at a local park.</p><p>The man who showed up? Not rugged. Not bearded. And most definitely not Brandon.</p><p>“Jessica?!” she blurted out, stunned beyond words. A distant acquaintance from college, Jessica managed the awkwardness with surprising nonchalance.</p><p>“I’m so sorry,” Jessica said, fidgeting with her purse strap. “I just really wanted to come out and—uh—practice meeting new people. But I didn’t think anyone would swipe on my real profile…”</p><p>Charlotte stared at her, mouth agape.</p><p>After a painful five minutes, Jessica gave a nervous laugh and scurried away. For the rest of the day, Charlotte vacillated between secondhand embarrassment and wondering whether or not this counted as performance art.</p><hr><h2 id=the-grand-finale-the-dude-with-too-many-frogs>The Grand Finale: The Dude with Too Many Frogs</h2><p>And then came Nigel. Nigel’s initial profile didn’t raise any red flags: he worked as a financial analyst, enjoyed weekend trips to the farmer’s market, and played the piano in his spare time. All perfectly normal.</p><p>What wasn’t normal, however, was how many frogs he owned.</p><p>“I should warn you,” he said during their date at a Mediterranean bistro, “I have a lot of frogs.”</p><p>Charlotte raised an eyebrow. “Frogs? Like… pets?”</p><p>“Oh, yes. I keep them in aquariums. There’s Geraldine, Croaky, Hamlet, Frodo, Princess Buttercup, Elliot—”</p><p>“A lot would be what, like five?” Charlotte tried.</p><p>Nigel proudly grinned. “Eighty-seven.”</p><p>Charlotte coughed, nearly choking on her wine. “Eighty-what?”</p><p>To his credit, Nigel was incredibly passionate about frog care and the preservation of amphibians. But as Charlotte listened to him describe the custom humidity levels of each tank in his apartment, she realized that unless she developed a sudden interest in amphibians, this wasn’t going to work.</p><hr><h2 id=the-moral-of-the-jungle>The Moral of the Jungle</h2><p>By the time her dating adventure hit the six-month mark, Charlotte knew two indisputable truths: the first was that online dating was a wilderness filled with the wildest creatures imaginable. The second was that she wasn’t done searching. Mismatched hobbies, strange habits, and disastrous dates could be hilariously unbearable, but there was always potential lurking behind the next profile.</p><p>As she deactivated her account for the umpteenth time, Charlotte didn’t feel defeated. Instead, she found herself laughing as she recounted her latest catastrophes to her friends over yet another brunch.</p><p>Because at the end of the day, a good story—even one about eighty-seven frogs—was worth its weight in gold.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/comedy-and-humor/>Comedy and Humor</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/dating-disasters-comedic-chronicles-of-love-gone-awry/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Dating Disasters: Comedic Chronicles of Love Gone Awry</span>
