His police shield gleamed with a dull luster as he strode towards the break room, eager to put his feet up and drown his sorrows in a steaming mug of coffee. But as he entered, the chatter coming from the officers halt, replaced by stares – some sympathetic, others suspicious.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the word, John?&rdquo; asked the grizzled vet, Detective Joe Ackerman. &ldquo;Find anything last night?&rdquo;</p><p>His face twisted into an ironic grimace, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d say the most troubling thing last night was the complete absence of clues.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not like you, Detective,&rdquo; mumbled another officer, Lila Stetson. &ldquo;Blind spots bugging you again?&rdquo;</p><p>Tanner shook his head, downcast. &ldquo;This is beyond a blind spot. It&rsquo;s some sort of booby trap being used these days. Knowing who or why though&mldr;&rdquo; His voice trailed off. He was frustrated – he felt like he was grasping at straws. After all, he was known as the undercover cop with the best intuition, the one who delivered criminals right into their cuffs. His skills had led him to solve countless bank jobs, robberies, and heists – all complex and sophisticated. But this new found challenge, blanketing his every move, was beginning to suffocate him.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s time you took a step back, John?&rdquo; Lila suggested, her concern plain for the concrete detective. &ldquo;You always thrive on your instincts, and right now they seem clouded.&rdquo;</p><p>Joe snorted, shaking his head. &ldquo;No, any prolonged break from a case, and it&rsquo;s game over, dame.&rdquo;</p><p>Lila rolled her eyes at the term. &ldquo;Fine. Then let&rsquo;s take this blind spot at a time and find who&rsquo;s pulling the strings to all these bank jobs.&rdquo;</p><p>As they discussed possible leads, in a dimly lit alleyway at the edge of downtown, Merrick, the mastermind behind the recent wave of bank jobs, laughed. He had heard whispers among the criminal underworld about the infamous Detective Tanner&rsquo;s frustrations. He continued to mastermind his crimes, confident that his untraceable method would keep him one step ahead.</p><p>However, as one of his newest henchmen, Reuben, iterated their holdings, Merrick&rsquo;s smile faded. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re running low on the materials needed for the booby traps, that&rsquo;s the main reason causing the delay in our next hit.&rdquo;</p><p>Merrick nodded, a look of cold determination morphing his face. &ldquo;Then we will need to accelerate our operations. Fast. Push harder. We do not need that Tanner fellow to figure out our secret. If anyone comes close to catching on, they get eliminated without hesitation.&rdquo;</p><p>Reuben gulped, as unease settled uncomfortably in his gut. He wasn&rsquo;t privy to what Merrick already knew or could do – but he knew he had to assume everything was dangerous or lethal.</p><p>Two days later, the Union Central Bank would be the next target. And tonight, no such blind spots would impede Merrick&rsquo;s plans.</p><p>Meanwhile, Detective Tanner furiously debated on whether to take Lila&rsquo;s advice or not. Unable to make up his mind, he conceded to throwing extra men into the operation, preparing and stressing for the impending heist. The security footage they had missed any major clues – suspicious individuals lurking the area, ghastly red herrings, and simply, nothing.</p><p>That identical night, as the clock doggedly ticked closer to the bank&rsquo;s closing hours, the sound of upon nearer and nearer pneumatic hinge of the bank vault door filled the air around. Tanner, now relying heavily on the instincts that were once robust, lurked knee-crouched with the other officers, anticipating trouble.</p><p>Just as the vault&rsquo;s door came ajar, a couple gunshots cracked through the air. The officers with Tanner likewise slammed their triggers, but their marked desperation was on Merrick&rsquo;s delight. Their ricocheting bullets provoked through the facility, a panic enhancing it.</p><p>&ldquo;They?&rsquo;ve got us pinned down!&rdquo; Ackerman cried.</p><p>&ldquo;Take cover!&rdquo; roared Tanner, watching with horror as the glass in the vault shattered – and nothing. He knew that sound. Disbelief riddled him. Inaudibly, he whispered, &ldquo;No&mldr;&rdquo; The coordinated well-placed flashes of fireworks illuminating his blackout point, instead of eye-opening explosions, provided security – Merrick had indeed caused another blind spot. The AngularFire display momentarily obstructing their sight, their bullets never would anticipate their targets.</p><p>&ldquo;My God, they&rsquo;re&mldr; they&rsquo;re using sound-based booby traps&mldr; a sonic weapon&mldr;&rdquo; stuttered Stetson, genuinely astonished. Feeling an indescribable dread, she continued, &ldquo;That sound is disorienting&mldr; maybe it scrambles our hearing? Makes us unable to respond or hear anything?&rdquo;</p><p>Clouded perplexity choked Tanner. Similar confusion clung, gleefully, onto the faces around him. It was not just the victims who felt this surrender practically morph fused into his dread to being incomprehensively gain leverage, in control. The criminal mastermind, Merrick, had perfectly planned the heist – not an inch out of place. His stakes were higher, due to the persistent managing eyes of Detective John Tanner, and a tick, a kernel of discomfort lodged in his heart as his gut was telling him that this complex orchestration of feints, decoys, and audacity chillinged most ominous burglanes&rsquo;, as well as law enforcers'.</p><p>The foiled heist passed, the result signifying nothing more than a breathed sigh from everyone involved, who then resumed to their normal everyday dull routine whilst the bank&rsquo;s walls constrained avarice and vulnerability. Nevertheless, these ponderings would not leave Merrick. Unbeknownst to him, uniform secretive attempts in the police station crumbled his plans, escalated the orchards to the top.</p><p>Back in the station, the exhaustion was emblematic with equal parts of despair, and annoyance – they seemed to be making headway on finding a stone-cold lead: they still could not put two and two together. Tanner attributed any praise to luck, but in the quiet spaces of his mind, he pondered if his gut feelings and instincts were becoming too mush to fall back upon. They needed answers; real answers.</p><p>The thieving crew, Merrick, and Reuben, met in some dim-lit lounge with a stressfully new development. Merrick had to face the crisis, they reckoned one of their guys was a snitch. Someone among them was providing the police with crucial intel on their operations. How else could they completely turn the tables on them? Factions within, fueled by regret slinking thoughtfully, of most menacing and dangerous organizations threatened to shake their once-secure rooting – careful patience, a fancy veneer befriending for calamitous anarchy.</p><p>Stetson, warned by Tanner earlier not to grow complacent after revealing their discovery earlier, was now flooded with possible influences – society indifferent, over-analogy, daydream corrupt. Regardless of when the decision was made, the solution gave unlit silence; they wouldn&rsquo;t seal their lips wide – his treacherous mark was amongst them. With every subsequent hit, Merrick&rsquo;s exposure as their plans increased markedly.</p><p>Then, Merrick&rsquo;s attention was suddenly snapped when he noticed Tanner had found a new ally. That blinding, relentless detective appeared to be adopting a new skill set, and it unnerved him. He pondered his potential chaos unveiling under Tanner&rsquo;s new pursuit – using the same disorientating sound grenade he&rsquo;d placed at the bank. Everything about this heist had been intricate and calculated – but entirely untested.</p><p>What other gifts was Tanner receiving from his fellow officers? Determined to stay ahead of his unwavering shadow, Merrick decided they&rsquo;d regroup in ten days. The small sideline of information that had fallen off his radar, Tanner, was successfully amassing a force.</p><p>&ldquo;Please,&rdquo; he whispered. Despite the despair crawling up his throat, he smiled grimly, looking at his team in the dim light. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll nail you soon enough, Merrick. Just give us time.&rdquo; His colleagues supplying satisfied confidence, Tanner and his team had found a new advantage, against enemies mode armored like reptiles. They&rsquo;d employed their unconquerable, tenacious advertising for audacity – the reinvigorating sound.</p><p>As the window of the bank job approached, Tanner felt the surge of the well-worn confidence, no longer sandwiched by those deafening blasts, washed over his nine fears like a rainstorm. A storm threatening thunderous inevitability but one offering a new sense of tranquility – one invincible equilibrium.</p><p>Their skirmish progressed to its finest crescendo. Merrick&rsquo;s blinds spots aimed to be crucial turncoats; he burned with fury seeing Tanner&rsquo;s ally displaying successively tripling the police attacks, closely aligned to their strategic force. He was being pushed far lower in this proud-serious charade – he stumbled into the shadows.</p><p>No force seethed with as crushing desperation as when Merrick saw his unyielding nemesis, John Tanner, invoking the sound grenade –- but now it was held by its ally. The once incapacitating weapon now a sight of disabling pulverization. The sound grenade&rsquo;s reveal, as much as it ripped into Merrick&rsquo;s heart, clarified his vendetta. He made a last-ditched resolution that he&rsquo;d resort to amost-facist loner, selling his most treasured assets – time and strength.</p><p>Tanner faced Merrick – the battle equally as old and monumental as the city itself. Sensing his last chance of defeat inevitable, Merrick feasted on one expected plan. A desperate, seemingly saintly terrorist, he kneaded the decision of precipitant execution into action.</p><p>A chaotic madness had seized Merrick then. His apparent self-justification, a penance, via reins of false constraining rages sweated and slaved in desiring Tanner&rsquo;s sudden downfall – but his falling as he&rsquo;d unknowingly plummeted. Criminal mechanics of debauchery said this was his last desperate stick, jarred by the tremors of impending weariness.</p><p>As last dusk shrouds, deepening their continental shadows Merrick knew his fate miserably triumphed over the reigns of control. He knew he&rsquo;d almost reached the ultimate finesse, his last-footwork treacherous whimper; but it had dawned on him the very quality he deemed dangerous in others proved equal among his pursuers. In the terrifying fracas of their high-stakes struggle, Merrick had unduly detected the deaf silence in their adversaries&rsquo; victory songs. That was when he exasperated his subservient creature.</p><p>His delusions faded, and he vibrated in communicative inertness of submission – pencil errors written out within his stronger forbearance’s mission of vengeance. Feeding vast fiery perplexities, by some tang of moral choices underrated, Merrick attained the balance of spiced suffering entitlement he had declaimed. Significantly veering off course, he&rsquo;d feel the union of palpable despair and the forthcoming throe.</p><p>And so out from the countless Birmingham sinners, the toppled demon who paralleled a colonized audacity quietly faltered. The victory indistinguishably banded taut, flowing like the gravel-roughened rhythm rippling in the most resonant harmony.</p><p>As the police towed away the wreckage, the abandoned sound grenades and fear-fueled memories, a legendarily astute thought enshrouded the final denouement. Merrick&rsquo;s blind spots, these challengers beyond Tanners&rsquo; grasp, somehow had exposed him. The hunted hadn&rsquo;t forgotten to become a hunter. It was how legends were made, and their saga had just begun.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/robbery-and-heists/>Robbery and Heists</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/blind-spot-bandits-the-gps-robbed-fort-knox/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Blind Spot Bandits: The GPS-Robbed Fort Knox</span>
