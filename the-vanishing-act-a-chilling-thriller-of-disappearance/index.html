It was the kind of town most people didn’t leave, a place where the roads didn’t lead anywhere important, and secrets lingered like smoke in the air. Everyone knew your name, your business, and your family history, but despite the intimate ties, there was an unspoken rule: ask too many questions, and you’d find yourself on the outside looking in.</p><p>Holly Grayson wasn’t what you’d call an outsider, but she was close. She hadn’t grown up in Hollow Bend, and to some, that was reason enough to eye her with a quiet suspicion. She had moved to town two years ago after a bitter divorce, drawn in by the promise of an affordable Victorian-era house and the kind of stillness she hadn’t felt in years. Stability was all she wanted—a solid ground under her feet and a chance to rebuild herself away from the life she had shed.</p><p>For a while, it worked. Holly took up a job at the town’s library, befriended her neighbor Elaine—a widowed florist with a penchant for baking sourdough bread—and joined the local book club. Her life became an easy rhythm: mornings walking her golden retriever, Jasper; afternoons shelving books and chatting with regulars at the library; evenings filled with steaming cups of tea and novels she had the luxury to read without interruption. There had been no reason to expect anything would change.</p><p>Until it did.</p><p>It started innocuously, the way most storms do. It was a Thursday evening in late October, the air carrying the tang of damp leaves and woodsmoke. Holly had been at the book club, where the group was debating a mystery novel’s unsatisfying ending. Elaine had driven her home afterward, insisting on waiting to see Holly safely through her weather-beaten gate. That was the last time anyone in Hollow Bend saw Elaine alive.</p><hr><p>The next morning, Holly noticed something odd: Elaine’s bakery delivery van was parked diagonally across her driveway, as though it had been hastily abandoned. The back doors were flung wide open. Thinking Elaine had left it there during a sourdough emergency, Holly walked over to investigate—but Elaine wasn’t in sight. Nor were her usual cartons of baked goods.</p><p>By noon, Hollow Bend was buzzing. Sheriff Carter, a man who looked like he was carved from the same granite that bordered the town, had been summoned after Elaine’s teenage grandson called to report her missing. Holly joined the crowd forming outside the florist shop, the locals whispering furiously among themselves.</p><p>&ldquo;She wouldn’t just leave town,&rdquo; insisted Mrs. Greeley, the town’s self-proclaimed historian. &ldquo;Not Elaine. She’s been here longer than most of us, God bless her soul.&rdquo;</p><p>Sheriff Carter raised a weathered hand, silencing the crowd. &ldquo;We’re launching a proper investigation, I promise you. But if anyone’s seen or heard anything unusual since last night, it’s best you come forward now.&rdquo;</p><p>Silence followed. People shifted uncomfortably, exchanging hesitant glances. Holly felt her chest tighten; she knew what they were thinking. She wasn’t one of them—not really. She hadn’t lived there long enough to fully earn their trust. The tension in the air was palpable.</p><p>Everything about the morning felt wrong. She couldn’t shake the memory of Elaine’s van outside her own house, and worse still, she couldn’t shake the nagging thought she might have seen something from her bedroom window during the night. A shadow, faint and fleeting, had passed across her curtains just after she’d gone to bed. At the time, she’d convinced herself it was nothing—just Jasper shifting restlessly at the foot of her bed, or maybe the wind stirring the branches of the poplar tree. Now, she wasn’t sure.</p><p>She considered telling the sheriff. But what would she say? Maybe it was nothing; maybe it was everything. Holly stayed quiet.</p><hr><p>In the days that followed, the search for Elaine became frantic. Volunteers scoured every inch of the woods behind her house, leaflets with her picture were tacked to every telephone pole, and dogs trained to sniff out missing persons patrolled each winding dirt road. Still, there was no sign of her. Not a clue, not a trace. Elaine had vanished into thin air, and Hollow Bend had turned quiet—but not peaceful. It was the kind of quiet that burrowed into your bones, hollowed you out. A waiting quiet.</p><p>And then, the notes started.</p><p>It was Henry Bourne, the greengrocer, who found the first one. It was tucked beneath his windshield wiper one crisp November morning. There were no fingerprints on the paper, and its message was simple: <em>She’s gone where you can’t follow.</em> The handwriting was strange—blocky, uneven, and disjointed, as though it had been scrawled in haste.</p><p>More notes followed, each one left in odd locations across town. One appeared taped to the library’s glass entrance, another clung defiant against a lamppost after a heavy rainstorm. The notes didn’t mention Elaine by name, but speculation ran unchecked. Some believed they were warnings—cryptic signals to stop seeking answers where none could be found. Others thought they were taunts.</p><p>Sheriff Carter dismissed them as the work of a prankster, though his increasingly weary expression betrayed his frustration. Hollow Bend was slipping from his grasp. And Holly? She couldn’t shake the feeling that someone was watching her. It wasn’t paranoia—not exactly. She’d catch glimpses of black-coated figures darting around corners, or maybe hear the crunch of footsteps behind her only for the sound to vanish when she turned. It left her awake at night, staring into darkened corners of her room, Jasper snoring obliviously at her side.</p><hr><p>A week after Elaine’s disappearance, Holly received her own note.</p><p>It was tucked into the mailbox, sealed in a plain white envelope. She almost didn’t notice it amidst the pile of junk mail and utility bills. But when she unfolded the paper, her breath hitched.</p><p><em>You saw me.</em></p><p>Three words, nothing more. But they hit her like a punch to the gut.</p><p>Heart pounding, she turned the paper over, as though some explanation might be scrawled on the back. There was nothing. Jasper barked from the living room, his tail wagging furiously as he stared at the curtained window as if he’d seen something—or someone.</p><p>A wave of nausea rolled through Holly. She grabbed her coat and the note, locking the house behind her as she hurried straight to the sheriff’s office. For all her doubts about him, Carter’s expression turned steely the moment he read her note. He asked her to recount anything unusual she’d seen on the night in question, but when she told him about the fleeting shadow, his jaw tightened.</p><p>&ldquo;You should stay close to home. Lock your doors and windows,&rdquo; he said after a long pause.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you think someone’s trying to threaten me?&rdquo; she asked.</p><p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he replied, holding her gaze, &ldquo;you’ve seen more than you realize.&rdquo;</p><hr><p>That night, the air felt oppressive, charged with something Holly couldn’t define. She double-checked each lock and even slid a heavy chair beneath the front door handle, though the rational part of her mind knew it offered no real protection. What was she afraid of? Shadows? Notes? The truth?</p><p>Sleep evaded her, and the night stretched endlessly. It was just after 3 a.m. when something woke her—a sound. Faint, yet distinct. A rhythmic creaking, like floorboards groaning underfoot. Jasper growled low in his throat beside her. Holly’s heart thundered.</p><p>She crept toward the noise, gripping a flashlight like a weapon. The sound came from the back of the house, near the kitchen. When she reached the doorway, she froze.</p><p>The back door was slightly ajar, the night pressing in through its slender crack. A cold gust swept into the kitchen, carrying with it the smell of damp earth. On the countertop, resting as though deliberately placed, was a single object: one of Elaine’s favorite sourdough loaves.</p><p>And next to it, scrawled on a torn strip of brown paper, was a chilling message:</p><p><em>You’re next.</em></p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/mysteries-and-thrillers/>Mysteries and Thrillers</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-vanished-virtuoso-of-violet-valley/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Vanished Virtuoso of Violet Valley</span>
