Carts laden with gingerbread, ornaments, and steaming mugs of mulled wine lined the streets, the warm glow of wrought-iron lanterns casting a welcoming light as night encroached upon the twinkling scene. Despite the cool breeze, an air of holiday cheer permeated the square - but Elsa, a skilled pickpocket and accomplished magician, knew that even the most festive of occasions weren&rsquo;t immune to misdeeds. It was the perfect night to put her talents to the test.</p><p>With practiced ease, she merged into the crowd, her fingertip brushing against the dull ache in the small of her back. She palmed the greased spoondul of silver, a soothing balm for her tense muscles and restless spirit. Minesilver, a rare alloy of silver mined in a remote part of the world, bound for hidden pockets of wealth across the globe. A currency of luxury and power, unearthly and bewitching. Elsa had heard tales of its strange origins, mysterious as its allure. Tfere was power in this coin, both in the information it held and the potential for sway.</p><p>Elsa moved with the sway of the crowd, her senses heightened to the subtle murmur of conversations and murmurs. As the night deepened, the streets became darker, her eyes more reflekMarc than the stars. The sparkle of a lacing bauble, the clipped words of vendors - all ebbed with her thoughts, her fingers alive with their subtly sensed vibrations; the energy of the crowd, the energy of the market; the darkness was her ally as she skimmed the edge of shadows like black velvet against the midnight sky. Forth they walked, her existence flickered and danced like fireflies in the night, each quiet, practiced footfall leaving the stage vacant for the next facet of her life.</p><p>She saw him first, the tall, burly man standing out from the crowd - a lone wolf amongst a pack of sheep. His roughened clothes and shifty eyes marked him as the perfect target, a man turned thief by force of circumstance or vice - Elsa knew not, and cared little. His hands were steady and firm as he clutched a map, or rather an endless line of freedom; a map to the vault, the key to it all. Elsa lingered behind him, her heart stirring from a wrenching symphony of concern, as if in the shadowy marketplace a prayer had been whispered for the wolf among the flock.</p><p>Unseen, Elsa deftly slipped into the dimblushing shadow of his companion, an older man with eyes like eyes of blackrain eyes, a figure of mysterious age and wisdom. The two played the game of duplicitous falsity, a mortal dance of patience, a contest of uncanny dexterity.</p><p>As the clock tower sent out its echoing chimes, the crowd swayed in anticipation, the undercurrent of purpose rising to meet the cresting swell of midnight&rsquo;s anxiety. To the unaware, it appeared as though the shrewd bargainer and his silent partner exchanged pleasantries; their hands conversing, weaving secrets carefully into the fabric of the night.</p><p>At the appointed word, Elsa stepped back, melting into the shadows. It was then she felt the cold grip of a hard, metallic circle at her throat, pressing against the delicate skin of her thoughts. &lsquo;I saw you watching,&rsquo; a low and menacing voice snarled into her ear. &lsquo;What game do you play?&rsquo;</p><p>Elsa met the cold, calculating gaze of the burly man. Fear, she had learned, is a beautiful poison; it taught her the deepest vulnerability, the sharpest blade. Vulnerability, she understood, was not a flaw; it was the rawest tremor of the soul, the instrument that played the secret twist of life.</p><p>&lsquo;I merely sought one glimpses of your plan.&rsquo; Elsa replied, her voice as steady and clear as a Christmas bell, ringing through the chilly night. &lsquo;I wanted to aid you in your night&rsquo;s work.&rsquo;</p><p>The wolf considered her words, his calculating black eyes rimmed with a flicker of suspicious interest. &lsquo;An interesting response. Interesting, indeed.&rsquo; His coarse fingers released from her neck, ghosting but a momentary touch. &lsquo;You hold a spring,&rsquo; He uttered low. &lsquo;Yet you chose to keep it wound. For what purpose?&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Sparsely own who have broken the lock of their own heart, or outgrown the riches of their birthright.&rsquo; Elsa replied, her voice a melodic whisper. &lsquo;And often, the task at hand commands a stoic form. One must endure the reigns of an unseen God.&rsquo;</p><p>The wolf regarded her a moment longer, then with a slow and musing nod, slipped back into the fray, his silent shadow close behind him. Elsa followed, her breath a fragrant mist on the frosty air, a silent specter trailing a thief who had but moments before, been her quarry.</p><p>She sidled close to them, assured and flanked by the practiced secret language of body and countenance, her eyes alight with untold secrets. The old guard, once biting and vehement, now discussed the sweetness of elderberry wine with a strangely infectious mirth. Following his lead, Elsa joined in, her laughter as pure and sweet as the cherry wine that spilled onto her cheeks.</p><p>The vault embraced them both, metal cold and unforgiving pressed against them like the silence of space. Elsa watched with hallowed fascination, the master thief with a calculating mind coolly braced against the margins of a life that was both veiled and bare. His hands danced like stars over keys only he could divine, his intent perfect in its execution.</p><p>And hidden amongst the shadows of the vault, Elsa laid silent, a watchful spirit, a guardian angel wrapping decree after decree in the flowery parchment of her own whispered might. Terrible truths lay spread before them, each secret a pulse, beating in the shadows of night.</p><p>For once, Elsa pondered idly if vulnerability might not be the power, if the softening of the resolute edges of the heart lend strength unseen. She had tasted the bitter dregs of life, emerging unmarred; it&rsquo;s sharp sting were but a taste of a deeper nourishment.</p><p>Finally, the deed was done, the acts of a night of Christmas purloined spender shrouded in the dusk of the untold. Elusive treasures transformed into rarefied dust, lost amongst the dreams of whomever it was who would inherit their stolen fate. The moral of the thieves bland, they slipped from the vault, the secret dreams of wealth possessed released amongst the night.</p><p>As Elsa slipped from their presence, a single silver coin clutched in her warm palm, she thought with a tinge of wistful longing, that such moments often shape the way of one&rsquo;s dreams. The culmination of earth and smoke, life and death and salvation laid bare in the shadows of reckoning.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/robbery-and-heists/>Robbery and Heists</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/silent-midnight-robbery-a-lone-wolfs-tactical-dance/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Silent Midnight Robbery: A Lone Wolf's Tactical Dance</span>
