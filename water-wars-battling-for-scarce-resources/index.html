The increasing population, combined with a stubborn resistance to adapt to a new reality, led to absolute chaos. It all started with a simple problem: water. The world had stopped abundant water a hundred years back, but civilization marched on, screaming into the abyss of scarcity.</p><p>The cities grew thirstier, people thirstier, the crops thirstier; everywhere thirst consumed, and with it, desperation. It began slowly, at first - small, petty battles over the precious resource. And then in the blink of an eye, just like that, the future had evolved into a dystopian horror, the Water Wars were underway.</p><p>The world had divided into regional groups, the desperate alliances falling more and more in the clutches of the private military corporations providing protection in exchange for a share of the water. In the heart of this mess was Elli, a 17-year-old girl living in Sear’s End, a bustling commercial hub in Califo, rumored to have access to some underground untouched source of water.</p><p>Elli’s job was to serve at the Water Board - an essential establishment where limited water was rationed to the parched city. She stood, grasping the rickety counter, looking out over the cacophony of sufferings before her. Every day, desperation struck sharper, the smell of blood hung acrid in the air, hopes washed away, dreams drowned.</p><p>Still, life had to go on. Elli had dreams of her own. A mysterious seed of hope nestled itself in her heart; it whispered that somewhere up north, beyond the Great Divide, lay a hidden water haven. It was called the Oasis.</p><p>The story of the Oasis was rumored to have been started by a group of rebels a decade ago, daring to venture beyond the borders of their own parched domain. Tales of them struck fear in the hearts of the cautious eyes of Califos and other regional powers. They preached the virtues of resource sharing and cooperation. But for Elli, it was the beacon of hope offering her a chance to make a difference.</p><p>Only one man approached the counter, his face hidden under a crude cowl. The Water Board recorded his daily ration, and Elli could tell he had reached the end of his credit. Casting a glance upwards, she added her own voice to the crowd, &ldquo;Oasis?&rdquo;</p><p>The man nodded at her, and without a word, shoved a paltry sum of cash towards her. Elli smiled. It had been a few days since her last escape into the sprawling city; she couldn&rsquo;t resist the allure of the Forbidden anymore.</p><p>Leaving her shift, Elli prepared to meet Max, an old friend who’d already made the leap to join the rebels. His ability to gather information about the Oasis would help her infiltration. Meeting at one of the clandestine hangouts under the guise of a fading amusement park, they agreed to venture into the wild.</p><p>For two days, they moved cautiously, avoiding military patrols, passing black market merchants and cornered their target: an abandoned factory rumored to hold secret passages to the Oasis.</p><p>Their first day arrived amidst a quiet dawn in the abandoned factory. Sweat-drenched, they found themselves in a decrepit room filled with ancient machinery. Amidst the debris, Elli spotted an air duct hidden behind a wrongly hinged door.</p><p>Max looked at her, his eyes alive with hope, and together they squeezed into the cramped duct. Elli fixed her scarf over her nose, the fabric soaked with water to keep the dust at bay. As they crawled, the hope tasted metallic, the burden of the future heavy on their shoulders.</p><p>The air duct dropped down over a river - Elli could swear she heard water flowing beneath her, its music more powerful than the blood thrumming in her ears. Their hands shook as they opened the door to their freedom.</p><p>It took just one glance at the sprawling city, swaying from heat and thirst, to make the choice. Smiling, Elli breathed in the smell of the Oasis, with water in abundance seeping into every crack, every crevice, every pore.</p><p>The next dawn, Max and Elli walked side by side, unified - living for the rebellion, living for the Oasis.</p><p>Their whispers were like the cool wind that danced. Hope. Dreams. And the thirst of an arid world were unlike anything they’d seen in a long while.</p><p>Together, they would change the course of destiny - for no water is too precious to be fought over. Passionately, they would help the societies that had lost hope, together building bridges against the thirst.</p><p>Time had granted them a splendid gift: Water - the most precious resource in the world. And in the words of the Oasis, they would fight for it - together.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/climate-change/>Climate Change</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/waking-the-eco-giants-climate-change-awakening-for-animals/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Waking the Eco Giants: Climate Change Awakening for Animals</span>
