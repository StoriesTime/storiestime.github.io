It was here, in this town of half-sleeping dreams, where I found myself, Sebastian—the eternal chronicler of love&rsquo;s sorrows, eternal comforter’s grief, and the whisperer among the heart&rsquo;s silent cries.</p><p>My domain, an ancient oak standing as the guardian of Everwood&rsquo;s heart, thrived amidst the whispers of time. As the leaves of gold and emerald danced under the caress of the moon&rsquo;s silver downpour, stories of love and the bittersweet pangs of unreciprocated passion found solace within my branches.</p><p>One particularly wistful full moon, the air bore the fragrance of unspoken fervor and wailing hopes. Echoing through the night, like a lover&rsquo;s vow to the stars, was the voice of Elara, whose story had taken residence within my extensive verse of lost seraphims.</p><p>“Dearest Oak, protector of the supplicants of love—listen, for your whispering soul hears the anguish of my heart.” Her confession, equal parts agony and euphoria, reached my silence. Her lilac eyes glistening in the pale moonlight, seeping through the canopy of stars that girded the azure veil above, held within them all the sorrow and trepidation that her quivering voice could not.</p><p>“I gave her my heart, a heart that has loved naught but her. Yet she, she told me in the tender night&mldr; that mine is naught but a tender lie.” Elara&rsquo;s alone wails pierced the hush of the world, and the soft breeze that once coaxed the silver leaves to sigh, instead swelled with her torment. “Her hands, so cold, they pushed me away&mldr; Oh, great oak, my heartfelt wounds, mingled with thorns of unrequited love, yearn for your touch&mldr;”</p><p>As Elara lamented under the boughs of my ancient embrace, my roots permeated the very essence of her sufferings, and my limbs, like tender hands, received the weight on her bearing grieve. In my heart, spanning the ages, her agony mingled with those of numerous unfortunates, whose stories now lay dormant, ready to be healed, or lamenting, depending on the sincerety of their need.</p><p>As the full moon amassed its vigor, as darkness vanished in its heavenly light, a unity of tears and lost joys hovered between realms of love and pain. I held Elara close within the eternal boons whispered by my leaves, seeking solace, awaiting the next turn of the world. I sought the wisdom of time to share solace with her, and in doing so, heal the heartfelt wounds of unrequited love that bound her, bleeding heart in hand, to the walls of her longing.</p><p>As the chosen scribe of love, I rose in the wee breaths of the dawn, my strength waning with the ebbing moon. Elara still lay by my roots, her tear-filled eyes closed, gentle breaths trickling through her parted lips. In the quiet of the day, with a whisper all my own, I shared with her a tale, a legend, borne of ancient syllables etched into the heartwood I once was to this realm:</p><p>“In the far-reaching land of Duoethra, where the river of Stars bore life and dreams, love reigned, pure and unwavering, like the eternal vigilance of the moon.” In lush booms, I dove into the woven roots of time, invoking the words of hallowed sages and the echoes of forgotten love.</p><p>“There, in the white matrix of verity, resided the Wandering Weaver, Quilombro of the Unseen, he who with shimmering threads of life, sculpted the very essence of love. Quilombro, known to all hearts along the Folded Waters, was wise beyond the star&rsquo;s highest flight, his loom, attuned to the rhythm of life, wove the dreams of love that time could never unfold.”</p><p>Elara&rsquo;s eyes fluttered with each turn of my narrative, her breaths deepening in harmony with the ancient words. “Thus began the tumultuous tale of two souls. Rowena, whose love was pure and shining brighter than the midsummer sun; Evander, the traveler, haunted by the silence of a love long past. Rowena, the fairest bride of Duoethra, bare her heart before Evander, as he roamed beyond the shores of her longing. Evander, void of the warmth in the cold clutch of sorrow, dared not the embrace of love, before his heart found solace in the veil of the unseen.”</p><p>I breathed the tale of the Weaver who longed to touch the heart of love, to mend the unfathomable wounds Evander had long borne. “Quilombro, with threads of gold, crimson, and silver, wove a tapestry of dreams, a gossamer lattice of love strong enough to bridge the expanses harbored in the lover’s heart. Rowena, victorious at last, became the epitome of beauty and love, her radiant essence transforming the loom into a resounding symphony of colors. Yet Evander, the wandering traveler, deaf to the melody, continued his forlorn journey.”</p><p>“Yet oh, the tale does not despair. For the Weaver, sensing the lament of the land filled with the Unsigned, embraced the image of longing. He whispered the silent prayer, and his loom shook with a quivering heartbeat. Eyes filled with love, Quilombro knew that none could part the hearts of love&rsquo;s Unsigned, yet in silence, he vowed to guard Rowena&rsquo;s love. In the corners of the Stars River, the Weaver wove a shroud of stillness, pondering the depths of love unknown, woven into threads of the very essence of time.”</p><p>“Evander, in his silence, found solace with those who love in silence; the land of the Unsigned. There, rows of purple fog gathered to sing the praise of the Weaver; their hearts a chorus to the hymn of longing. With their unspoken song, they danced to the rhythm of the Wandering Weaver&rsquo;s loom, drawn closer, ever so close to the touch of love.”</p><p>And now, the once facedown loom before the Wandering Weaver awoke. Fingers of ruby thread stretched to the edges of the dictum, weaving whispered prayers, beseeching the hearts of evanescent love to join the chorus. Love stitched into the essence of the unzippered mind, Rx finds solace in the tapestry of memories yet to come.</p><p>Elara, her lilac eyes alight with guidance, love awakening within, whispered her reverie: “Dearest oak, your words touch the unseen, and in them, I found a part of myself&mldr; forgotten, silently yearning.”</p><p>“There, in the purple fog of the Unsigned, I find my place, Rowena. My love&rsquo;s refrain echoes through the hearts of the land, Quilombro&mldr; and in time, whispered in words unspoken, reaching his silent resonance.”</p><p>I had given her a prize seldom granted even to the wisest: the understanding of her love&rsquo;s silent, unwavering strength. And while the true meeting of the hearts of Rowena and Evander were yet to fold, in the here and now, my words wove the healing of Unrequited Love, unfurling a canopy of hope – my own unique magic.</p><p>In my vault of knowledge, spanning boundless eras, I had seen Revana and her Evander. I would continue to uphold this vigil, long after the final stanza of the world&rsquo;s love sonnet rang with the echoes of eternity, sharing their succeeding tomorrows, even in the darkness of tomorrow&rsquo;s forgotten night. This ever-unfolding saga of love doth compete, an anthem of solace, in celebration of Elara, herself a part of love&rsquo;s eternal tapestry.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/love-and-heartbreak/>Love and Heartbreak</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/heartfelt-grief-a-mystics-encounter-with-loves-departure/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Heartfelt Grief: A Mystic's Encounter with Love's Departure</span>
