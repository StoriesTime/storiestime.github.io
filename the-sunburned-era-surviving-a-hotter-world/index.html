Miriam paused, pressing her palm against the cool metal wall, allowing the steady hum of the subterranean air conditioning to settle her nerves. The heat, even down here beneath layers of earth and concrete, was suffocating today. Her eyes flicked down to the faint glow of the biodynamic wristband signaling her body temperature—98.9 degrees Fahrenheit. Close, but not critical. Yet.</p><p>She clicked the comm-link strapped to her other wrist and whispered, “Raj, status on today’s surface readings?”</p><p>Static crackled, followed by Raj’s gravelly voice. “Higher than yesterday. We’ve clocked it at 123 in the Southern Zones and climbing—same issue in the Global Belt. I don&rsquo;t expect you up top for another hour. Prep for UV-resistant gear, standard issue, but you might feel a burn anyway if you&rsquo;re out too long.”</p><p>Miriam sighed. “Copy that. Keep me posted on any fluctuations.”</p><p>The Sunburned Era. That was what people had started calling it. The tipping point no one thought would come so soon had been reached decades ago, unraveling slowly at first, then all at once. Cities scorched under rising temperatures while crops withered under the relentless glare of the sun. The oceans shifted, swallowing low-lying countries. Those fortunate enough to afford it burrowed into the earth or fled to extreme northern and southern zones, carving out new lives in deeply uncertain futures.</p><p>Miriam had only known this world. Born two years into the Era, her first memories were of looking through protective shields at a blazing orange sun and choking on air barely breathable without a respirator. Yet she had made it to her late twenties, working as a field tech for Sunsecure Collective—a coalition of researchers and engineers fighting to sustain life on a planet that seemed intent on erasing their efforts.</p><p>As she geared up for the day’s surface duties, Miriam thought about the old stories—before the majority of open sky belonged only to memory. People spoke of mild summers, crisp winters, afternoon walks that didn’t require barrier creams or adaptive suits. They spoke of thriving forests in places that were now desolate sand expanses. Miriam clenched her jaw. Dwelling on the past made what remained that much harder.</p><p>She finished locking the seals on her UV armor and tapped the console at the launch gate. The heavy door groaned open. A blast of heat surged inward, nearly buckling her knees despite her preparation.</p><p>And there it was—the sun, unfiltered and menacing. Even seen through the goggles of her helmet, the light was almost unbearable. The landscape unfolded in shades of beige, gold, and pale red, utterly devoid of vegetation save for a few scraggly shrubs hugging the edges of the horizon.</p><p>Raj’s voice buzzed in her ears again. “There&rsquo;s a malfunctioning solar array in Quadrant Ten. That sector’s offline—we need you to recalibrate it before we lose storage capacity for the night.”</p><p>“Understood. Sending back relevant stats in real time. I’ll try not to fry out there,” she replied grimly.</p><p>Quadrant Ten was almost a mile’s walk through the open surface. While the array’s failure held the potential for catastrophic power loss to the underground city, reaching it meant hours of exposure to the unyielding sun. Despite advances in adaptive technology—like the cloaked pathways and air-cooled armor—it didn’t take much for the heat to seep through. She gripped the handles of her electric skimmer tightly and set off into the shimmering heat haze.</p><hr><p>By the time she reached the array field, the suit&rsquo;s internal cooling system was struggling to keep up. She dismounted from her skimmer and surveyed the machinery towering around her like skeletal giants. Several solar panels had tilted at awkward angles, one nearly shattered under pressure from a sudden windstorm that had struck weeks prior. Despite Sunsecure’s best efforts, sandstorms and atmospheric shifts had made surface operations unpredictable at best.</p><p>Miriam pulled a toolkit from her pack, locking her boots to the panel to keep her balance as she climbed up. Each movement was more difficult than the last. By the time she reached the top housing, her breaths had grown shallow. She gritted her teeth and got to work soldering broken connections and realigning pieces burnt under the relentless rays of a sun too close for comfort. Her visor flashed red with a system alert: ambient temperature was nearing unsafe human thresholds. Better make it quick.</p><p>“Raj,” she tried not to let the strain show in her voice, “I’ve patched the main connections on three panels. Running diagnostics now.”</p><p>A dry laugh came over the comm-link. “Biggest panel field we’ve got, and it decides to pressure us today. Figures. How’s the gear holding up?”</p><p>“Barely. Helmet’s thinned four degrees from thermal resistance. If I don’t finish this fast—”</p><p>Another surge of static interrupted her speech, followed by a sharp crackling noise that made her wince. Sometimes the intense UV radiation interfered with communications. She adjusted the line and was relieved to hear Raj’s voice distort back into clarity.</p><p>“—gust incoming!” Raj barked. “Westerly gust! Get out of there, now!”</p><p>All too late, Miriam saw the dull shimmer on the horizon. It could have been mistaken for the heat mirage that plagued the surface, but she’d seen it enough times to know better. The storm was incoming, a whirling surge of scalding air and sharp sediment that could rip through compromised panels—and human skin—like paper.</p><p>She scrambled back to the edge of the array, but her movements were sluggish from heat exhaustion. Each step felt heavier, the hot air curling into her lungs beneath the shielded ventilation. Sliding back down into the cloud of loose, sunburnt soil, she activated the retrieval beacon on her skimmer.</p><p>The storm slammed into her moments later, the force enough to knock her to the ground. Sand stung through the weak points in her suit. Vision blurred, and for a terrible second, she couldn’t tell up from down. The sun itself seemed to be swallowed in the chaos, the shards of light diffused so cruelly it became impossible to orient herself.</p><p>“Raj,” she croaked, though she wasn’t sure the comm system was still functional. “I need… exfil…”</p><p>Her hands clutched weakly at the skimmer’s handlebars as it skidded closer. Somehow, through instinct more reliable than anything else, she hauled herself onto the seat. The vehicle jolted to life, its auto-navigation directing her back to the city’s gate. The sandstorm roared behind her like a hungry beast, but she didn’t dare look back.</p><hr><p>Six hours later, Miriam sat in the cool confines of the debriefing room, sipping water laced with electrolytes under the watchful eyes of the med-techs. Her wristband gleamed verdant again, indicating stable vitals. Raj strode in, rubbing a hand across his grizzled face.</p><p>“Got the panel back online,” he said, settling in the seat next to hers. “It was touch and go, but your work carved enough time for the backups to kick in.”</p><p>Miriam nodded silently. Relief mingled with exhaustion in her veins. It was one day saved in a lifetime of barely surviving.</p><p>“You know,” Raj said carefully, “there’s talk of reducing surface missions. It’s getting worse up there.”</p><p>She met his eyes, a shadow of determination flaring in hers. “Then we work harder. There’s no space for quitting out here, Raj. Not if we still call this home.”</p><p>He didn’t push further. The unrelenting sun pulsed in both their minds, an ever-present challenge to be faced.</p><p>The Sunburned Era wasn’t over yet. But as long as the lights below still flickered on each night, they would endure.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/climate-change/>Climate Change</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-suns-fury-a-short-story-of-heat-and-drought/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Sun's Fury: A Short Story of Heat and Drought</span>
