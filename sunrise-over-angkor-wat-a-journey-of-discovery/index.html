She blinks into the darkness; the room is cloaked in deep blue shadows. Her small guesthouse sits just outside Siem Reap, tucked among tamarind trees and echoing the resigned hush of late night. She checks her watch—3:58 a.m. Almost time.</p><p>She slips from the tangled sheets, padding quietly toward her bag. The city’s evening laughter has dissolved into the faintest whisper—crickets, soft televisions, an occasional dog’s bark. Sothida dresses quickly: loose cotton trousers, linen blouse. From the balcony, humidity gathers on her skin, fresh as morning dew. She pulls her hair back, fastens her battered sandals, and tucks her camera into her old rucksack.</p><p>The sky is a pool of indigo as she slips out, the hostel’s gate squealing softly behind her. Already, tuk-tuks prowl the alleys—drivers leaning sleepily on handlebars, waiting for the day’s first pilgrims. Sothida waves at an older man nodding over his thermos. “Angkor?” she asks softly. He smiles, his face creased by a thousand dawns, and they strike a quiet bargain.</p><p>The tuk-tuk rattles through the empty streets. The temples draw everyone eventually—newlyweds, wanderers, lost souls, even Cambodians like her, born in exile and returned with hearts curious and unsteady. Sothida came to Cambodia searching for a story, or perhaps just herself. Her parents had left Phnom Penh decades ago, carving new names for themselves in Massachusetts. She grew up on stories—temples clad in lichens, monks in flaming orange, rivers of blood, rivers of lotus. But the stories always felt unfinished, heavy with mourning and hope.</p><p>As they pass the checkpoint, mist hovers in shaggy clouds above the grass. Tourists queue for tickets beneath harsh halogen lamps, clutching guidebooks and thermoses. Sothida’s Khmer passport earns her a quiet nod and a discounted fare.</p><p>Soon, the causeway comes into view. Angkor Wat stands in silhouette, five towers etched against the paling sky. The temple’s lotus towers—never a straight line, always folding, always symmetrical, as if the entire stone mass is breathing in, breathing out. The crowds part and clot, their hush growing as they prepare for the spectacle. Photographers jostle for the best vantage, tripods scratching the paving stones.</p><p>Sothida walks past them, leaving the main causeway for a side path. She wants to watch in solitude, to acknowledge her own space among the throng. She perches on a stone balustrade, the carved naga coiling beneath her hand. The night is beginning to thin; a hint of apricot seeps into the east.</p><p>As the horizon glows, memories surface—snatches of her mother, scraping lemongrass or humming beside the stove. Her father’s long silences at dinner. The old family album, filled with sepia people who looked like strangers. She remembers listening to the radio as a child; her mother crying during the news about Cambodia, her father closing the door and disappearing into the garage. They never explained why they left. Questions hung in the air, forbidden as ghosts.</p><p>Sothida is here to understand, to chase the empty spaces left by exile. The light blooms behind the towers; gold veils the sandstone, seeping into cracks carved nearly a millennium ago. Each block is layered with bas-reliefs—gods, demons, armies, women dancing, stories spun in stone. She reaches into her bag for her camera, framing the towers in the gentle sweep of dawn. Her finger hesitates on the shutter: she breathes in, slowly, and lets herself simply witness.</p><p>A monk’s saffron robe glides into her peripheral vision; he walks alone, barefoot, lips moving in silent prayer. Sothida is reminded of the tales her grandmother told of kings and serpent gods, of queens vanishing into lotus ponds, of new dawns after relentless darkness. The sun rises further. The towers blaze, their famous “quincunx” layout echoing in the pool where lilies float.</p><p>She lowers the camera. Around her, the crowd is hushed—awed, perhaps, but also reverential. Even the most committed Instagrammer fumbles for a moment’s stillness. The temple seems to breathe, a living thing, impossibly old and endlessly patient.</p><p>A local guide, plaid krama knotted at his throat, squats near the moat’s edge. He starts to explain the carvings to a group of visitors, his voice gentle but firm:</p><p>“Here is the Churning of the Ocean of Milk. The gods and demons pull the serpent Vasuki, hoping to create amrita—the nectar of immortality. But see, even as they fight, the waters swirl, and both sides must work together.”</p><p>Sothida listens. The story is an old one, but it rings with newfound clarity. Angkor Wat was born out of strife and grandeur, a monument both to devotion and to the heartbreak of empire. Stones stacked in the name of Vishnu, then claimed again for Buddha, then for Khmer kings—each layer another chapter in a history that refuses to stand still.</p><p>She rises and slips inside, following the cool corridor as it circles the main sanctuary. The galleries are crowded—Chinese tourists with umbrellas, French backpackers whispering, a family from Battambang murmuring prayers over lotus clusters. Sothida glides through, her steps faltering at the worn staircases. She finds a quiet nook, settling beneath an aspara whose features have been eroded by centuries of monsoon and hope.</p><p>She studies the bas-reliefs—columns of soldiers, celestial dancers, armies lost to time. Every face, even half-gone, looks both familiar and distant. A phrase from her mother’s language drifts up: “khnhom sok sabay te,” meaning, “I am at peace.” This is the Khmer her parents seldom spoke at home. Now she wishes she’d cherished every syllable, lingering long enough to sew it into herself.</p><p>As the sun climbs, the temple comes alive—swallows darting between colonnades, a wedding couple beaming in rented golden silk, guides rehashing the stories anew. Sothida watches a pair of children tuck incense and crackers before a weathered Buddha draped in tangerine sash. Their laughter tangles with the drone of cicadas and the low murmur of devotees.</p><p>Outside, the crowd moves on—buses honk, the roads fill, but Sothida lingers by the reflecting pool. The sunrise has faded, replaced by the harsher glare of day. Yet, she’s reluctant to let go. She kneels beside the cosmic moat, fingertips trailing in the water. In her reflection, she sees not just herself, but fragments of all who’ve come before—a continuous line of seekers, builders, refugees, and children holding secrets within their palms.</p><p>A tuk-tuk passes nearby. The driver she recognizes—a boy who’d laughed earlier with the other drivers, his cap askew. He offers her a ride with a nod.</p><p>She hesitates. Instead of replying, she pulls a notebook from her bag. Her Khmer is stilted, but she writes a single phrase: “I belong, here and elsewhere.” The words feel unfamiliar and liberating. Around her, the ruins persist—eroded but enduring, ancient but alive.</p><p>Sothida stands, brushes dust from her knees, and heads for the temple’s outer wall. Pigeons scatter ahead, wings flashing. The path winds through dappled shade and past groves of bodhi and frangipani. Tiny altars bloom beneath trees, incense curling around cellophane-wrapped fruit.</p><p>She pauses at a shaded shrine. An old woman sits on woven mat, tending a clutch of candles and jasmine. Their eyes meet; Sothida bows slightly, coins pressing into the woman’s weathered hand. The old woman mutters a blessing and hands her a garland, pale yellow and fragrant. Sothida is unsure what to say, but smiles her gratitude.</p><p>Her journey isn’t finished, and maybe it never will be. She traverses the ancient causeway back toward modernity, toward the city, toward her unfinished story. But something inside her has shifted—a weight softened, an echo acknowledged.</p><p>As Siem Reap stirs awake, the chorus of motorcycles and breakfast vendors rising, Sothida imagines her mother in Massachusetts, humming by the stove. She pictures her father in the garage, carving driftwood into shape. And she knows they, too, are part of the long arc stretching from exile to return.</p><p>At the city’s edge, tuk-tuks gather like dragonflies, bearing new pilgrims toward the temples with every breaking dawn. Sothida steps lightly down the dusty road, camera slung across her body, a fragment of garland clasped in her hand. She feels as if, for the very first time, the morning sun is rising not only over Angkor Wat, but inside her as well—blushing the old wounds, illuminating the quiet places of her heart.</p><p>She does not look back; the journey, now, is onward.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/iconic-landmarks/>Iconic Landmarks</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/sundials-and-spires-hidden-stories-of-big-ben/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Sundials and Spires: Hidden Stories of Big Ben</span>
