While his approach to advocating for Indian independence is widely known, there were secrets, veiled in the shadows of time, that remained unrevealed. To walk the path of nonviolence, as he did, means accepting the worst possible outcomes without retaliation or violence. Today, the secrets of his personal life - a love affair, a cunning plan, a special relationship with an unlikely ally - may be revealed. These secrets, unveiled, redefine our understanding of this legendary man.</p><p>Mahatma Gandhi, a simple man not after a kingdom, rather an independent India, was linked with a charming Bengali beauty named Abhilasha. Abhilasha, a Brahmo Samaj girl, was young and fiery, her spirit was pure, and her love for Gandhi was unadulterated. They communicated through letters, kept safe with her father, her secret admirer, and an ardent follower of Mahatma.</p><p>Gandhiji&rsquo;s love for Abhilasha was tumultuous, but in the name of his cause, he chose to remain celibate. His only solace was the shade of the neem tree on the loam-rich soil of Sabarmati. Abhilasha shared a similar sentiment, her love and her loyalty to Gandhi was pure, but in an era when the British rule was dictating women&rsquo;s rights and freedoms, she knew that love needed to take a back seat. For her love to be meaningful, it had to be of the motherland, a quenching of the thirst of India.</p><p>&ldquo;On the path of Nonviolence, the most violent restrain the self,&rdquo; said Gandhiji, but what ample amount of people do not know is how he managed to strategize a plan to thwart the salt monopoly of British East India Company. The spinning wheel, thrown into the lifestyles of millions of Indians, was a bait of deception, but it played its part as an outlet for the industrious nature of Indians. The very plan, hinged on deception, involved a secret relationship with a cunning ruler, a cleverly masked mastermind, and an influential trader.</p><p>However, in a world of politicians who neatly packed the lace of bability into the box of ability, many failed to understand the true essence of Gandhiji. Misinterpretations ensued, even amongst the families ofrss, the innate urge to bring forth their perspectives and versions of Gandhi caused the revered leader to be entrenched in a web of misinterpretations.</p><p>Gandhiji and his principles, deeply rooted in truth and nonviolence, were perceived as woolly-headed by some, and it stirred up strong resentment from individuals such as Subhas Chandra Bose and his supporters in the Hindu Mahasabha. But even amidst this adversity, the legacy of Gandhi continued to flourish. It became clear that he was a man of many trades - a politician, a social worker, a farmer, a philosopher, and perhaps most importantly, a lover of his motherland.</p><p>Gandhi&rsquo;s secret life, far from the masses, iterated that the path of Nonviolence, indeed, walks the path less tread. While he lived an extraordinary life, he was human, and these revelations remind us that even in our greatest advocates for peace and love, human nature prevails. Unraveling the story of Mahatma&rsquo;s private existence delves deeper into the complexity of a person rather than simply solidifying the hero-like image we have painted him to be. That, then, is the message which these secrets beholding the life of Gandhi introduce to us today: human vulnerability is universal, and so too is the capacity to rise above it.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/historical-figures/>Historical Figures</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/gandhis-path-the-journey-to-nonviolent-freedom/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Gandhi's Path: The Journey to Nonviolent Freedom</span>
