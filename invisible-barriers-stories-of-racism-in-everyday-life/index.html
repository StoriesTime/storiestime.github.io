She had learned to ignore the subtle discomforts of living in a city like New York, but today was different. The usual hum of the trains and chatter of commuters seemed louder than ever, filling the space between her thoughts with a sharp tension. As the train finally approached, Maya&rsquo;s eyes scanned the crowd, looking for a space to stand.</p><p>She had been commuting for years, navigating the city like everyone else, but today felt like an exception. It was the same train, the same route, the same faces, yet there was something about the way the others in the crowd stood—just a little too close, a little too far apart, as if the invisible barriers between them were sharper than usual.</p><p>As the doors slid open, Maya hesitated for a moment, watching the stream of passengers shuffle in and out. She had noticed this before—the way people would look at her differently. Her skin, a rich shade of brown, always seemed to make the space around her feel smaller. She had long learned to navigate these moments of discomfort, stepping aside when someone purposefully avoided her gaze, or when the woman with the briefcase elbowed past her without even a hint of apology.</p><p>But today, it wasn’t just the usual avoidance. Today, the air felt thick with something Maya couldn&rsquo;t name. She stepped into the train, choosing a spot near the door, not too far from the pole. She didn&rsquo;t want to risk standing too close to anyone else.</p><p>A man, probably in his early forties, stood in front of her, his coat too expensive for the early morning hour. Maya felt the subtle, electric current of unease as he glanced at her, then away. He adjusted his grip on the pole, shifting just a little to the right, as if giving her space, but it was more than just that. It was the deliberate way in which he avoided being too close to her. Maya noticed his quick, darting glance at the rest of the car, checking the proximity of other passengers, and the second he realized the only available space was beside her, he took a deep breath and moved just a fraction of an inch away.</p><p>She had seen it before—the quiet dance of avoidance that made her feel invisible in a world where she was anything but. The unwritten rules of proximity. The way people, without saying a word, navigated the world around her with the assumption that her presence was somehow too much. Too much space, too much noise, too much culture.</p><p>Maya closed her eyes, leaning her head against the cool glass of the window. She had long grown used to the idea that she would never really belong in spaces like this. The city was full of people, but it wasn&rsquo;t full of her. The invisible walls people built between themselves and others weren’t just figurative—they were real, tangible, and every day they seemed to grow taller.</p><p>As the train rumbled on, Maya thought about the many ways this had played out in her life. It wasn’t always this blatant avoidance; sometimes, it was more insidious. A glance, a comment, a moment of hesitation. Little things that left a mark. Little things that, over time, chipped away at her sense of belonging.</p><p>It reminded her of her first day at work. She had been excited, eager to make a good impression at the marketing firm where she had landed her first real job. It was a dream come true, and she felt the weight of her parents’ sacrifices pressing on her back as she stepped into the office that morning.</p><p>But the excitement quickly turned to confusion as she noticed how differently people looked at her. She had been hired for her skills, her qualifications, but in those first few days, the questions were never about her abilities. They were about where she was from, why she looked the way she did, why her name was “so exotic.”</p><p>At lunch, she sat at the far end of the cafeteria, making sure to avoid the eyes of the small group of colleagues gathered around the coffee machine. She had overheard their conversation—a joke about how they were all “lucky” that their boss had hired someone “so diverse,” as if it were some kind of charity. They laughed as if it were a joke Maya could share in, but it wasn’t funny. Not to her.</p><p>The conversations, the curious stares, the moments of discomfort piled up until Maya realized that she would always be the “other.” The only brown face in a sea of white, the only one whose name was hard to pronounce, the only one whose presence carried with it the weight of a thousand assumptions. She wasn’t hired for the work she did; she was hired to fill a diversity quota, to make the team look better, to check off a box on a form. It wasn’t just the visible things—the way her skin, her hair, her name, set her apart—it was the deeper, subtler things that made her feel like an outsider in a world that was meant to be her home.</p><p>But it wasn’t just in the workplace where these barriers existed. They were there, too, in the stores, in the restaurants, on the street. Maya had learned to recognize the signs early on—how the shopkeeper would watch her just a little too closely when she walked into a store, how the waitress at the restaurant would take longer to bring her water, even though the table next to hers had been served already.</p><p>It was all around her, invisible but ever-present. It was the way people spoke to her—slowly, as if she didn’t understand. It was the assumptions they made about her background, about where she came from, about who she was. Maya had grown accustomed to these subtle forms of racism, these everyday acts that felt like tiny jabs to the heart.</p><p>And yet, despite it all, she continued to move through the world, finding ways to carve out space for herself. She had learned to stand her ground, to hold her head high, to find the strength to push back against the tide of expectations that wanted to erase her.</p><p>But there was still something painful about it. Something exhausting. The constant awareness that the world saw her not for who she was, but for what they imagined her to be. The invisible barriers that separated her from the rest of the world, that made her feel less than, smaller, as if she were something to be tolerated rather than celebrated.</p><p>Maya thought about her parents, who had come to this country with nothing but hope and the dream of a better life for their children. They had worked hard to give Maya the opportunities they never had, to help her build a life that was full of promise. They never spoke about the racism they faced, but Maya knew it was always there, just beneath the surface. They had taught her to keep her head down, to work twice as hard, to never let anyone see her falter.</p><p>But Maya was tired. Tired of being the only one who had to work so hard just to be seen. Tired of being the only one who had to prove herself in a world that already decided she didn’t belong. She wanted to scream, to make them all understand. But instead, she did what she always did—she swallowed the frustration, pushed it down deep inside, and kept going.</p><p>It was then that the subway train jolted to a stop, and Maya’s thoughts were interrupted. She looked around, realizing that the man who had been standing in front of her was now gone. In his place stood an older woman, hunched over with a cane. Maya immediately stepped forward, offering her seat without hesitation.</p><p>The woman smiled at her, and for a moment, the invisible walls that had surrounded Maya seemed to fade. It was a brief, fleeting moment, but it was enough to remind her that even in a world full of barriers, there were still moments of connection.</p><p>And maybe, just maybe, that was enough.</p><hr><p>Maya stepped off the train at her stop, her mind still swirling with the thoughts of the day. The city, with its invisible barriers and quiet prejudices, was exhausting. But there was still something about it—the energy, the possibilities—that made her keep going. She knew that no matter how many walls the world put up in front of her, she would find a way to break through them. One day, maybe the walls would crumble entirely, and she wouldn’t have to navigate them anymore. Until then, Maya would continue to rise above them, stronger, more determined, and ready to make the world see her, truly see her, for who she was.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/racism-and-prejudice/>Racism and Prejudice</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/invisible-barriers-stories-of-prejudice-and-resilience/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Invisible Barriers: Stories of Prejudice and Resilience</span>
