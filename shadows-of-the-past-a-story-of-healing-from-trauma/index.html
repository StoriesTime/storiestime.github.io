As a renowned psychologist specializing in trauma recovery, Sophia had dedicated her career to helping individuals overcome their darkest moments. Yet, despite her expertise, she couldn't shake off the feeling of unease that had been lingering within her for weeks. The weight of her own past was finally catching up with her.
Sophia's sharp mind began to wander back to a event from her childhood, an incident so traumatic that it had left an indelible mark on her psyche. The memories, long suppressed, now resurfaced like a ghostly presence, threatening to upend her carefully constructed world. She had always prided herself on her ability to empathize with her patients, but now, she was forced to confront the parts of herself she had long buried.
One by one, the shadows of her past began to emerge, each one whispering its own tale of pain and sufferance. The faint outlines of her parents' grief-stricken faces, the sound of shattering glass, and the ultimate silence – all these fragments reassembled into a haunting narrative that had been hidden away for decades. It was as if the darkness had been conspiring to reveal its presence, waiting patiently for the perfect moment to unshackle itself.
Sophia felt a sense of disorientation wash over her, like being suspended in a timeless realm, where the linear progression of events had little significance. Every decision, every action, every moment in time, now appeared as nothing more than a perceived attempt to stave off the inevitable – her true purpose as a storyteller, leaving the cookies of human experiences laid bare for others to analyze.
As the therapist, her scientific knowledge and rational reasoning would have been the spearhead for bolstering her patients to break free from adversity. Yet now, for the first time in her conscious experience, Sophia felt that conundrum mirroring in every aspect of her own existence: slowly leaking malaise tearing at the very fabric of herself – mental stability and fatality. Her lesser exposed fears thereby started becoming quiet the sponsors while looking away incomes call incredibly vindicated aims.

In the quiet hours before sunrise, when the distractions of the world subsided, Sophia found herself entwined with the shadows of her past.
