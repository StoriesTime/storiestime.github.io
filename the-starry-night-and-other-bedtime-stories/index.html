When the sky bruised blue and the first silvery sparks flickered between the black pincushion branches, he called the children. They arrived one by one—May with her bright nightgown, hair in ribbons; gentle Toby in dinosaur pajamas; Hugo, the feral one, who often had wildwood leaves stuck in his mop of hair. When the constellation of his audience assembled, Nestor began his stories.</p><p>He never read the words. Instead, he tilted the book so its cover—a faded swirl of cobalt and gold—caught the lamplight and spoke to the children as if the tales flowed straight from the darkness outside his window.</p><hr><h3 id=the-legend-behind-the-starry-night>The Legend Behind The Starry Night</h3><p>&ldquo;Tonight,&rdquo; he said, voice dropping to a secretive hush, &ldquo;you’ll hear the truth behind the starry night. Not just what the eye sees, but what the sky remembers.&rdquo;</p><p>May’s eyes widened. She adored stories that took place somewhere above bedtime and below dreaming.</p><p>&ldquo;Before there were clocks and school bells, before the first sheep heard a human song, the world had only the Whisperer. She lived far above, somewhere between the last breath of dusk and the first shiver of dawn. Each night, she painted the sky anew. Not with patience, but with swirling, hurried strokes—brushing hope and longing and untold wishes right into the darkness.</p><p>&ldquo;Villages watched and wondered about these patterns. Sometimes, a farmer’s heart would feel heavy with loss, and a soft spiral of light might appear above his barn. Sometimes, an artist in love would sigh, and a bright, curious comet danced between the moon and a gentle planet.</p><p>&ldquo;But the Whisperer never left the world below unpainted. Her greatest creation—one she could never recreate the same way twice—was the starry night. Some say she took lonely dreams from down here and sprinkled them in the sky, giving everyone a reason to look up and wonder. Look long enough, May, Toby, Hugo, and you’ll see glimpses of old wishes, of stories not yet finished, twinkling stubbornly above us.&rdquo;</p><p>Nestor closed his eyes as if he saw the ghostly starlight swirling behind his eyelids.</p><hr><h3 id=the-sleepy-meteors-promise>The Sleepy Meteor’s Promise</h3><p>Toby tugged at Nestor’s sleeve. &ldquo;Met—the stars ever fall down?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Nestor, &ldquo;that brings to mind the Sleepy Meteor. You lot heard of him?&rdquo;</p><p>They shook their heads.</p><p>&ldquo;He was the runt of all astrological things. Not bright enough for the sun’s court, not cool enough for a planet, but too restless for a pebble. So he wandered and wandered, sputtering here and there, looking for somewhere to feel at home.</p><p>&ldquo;One blue-gold evening, the Sleepy Meteor stumbled at the edge of the galaxy—tripped, really, over his own tail. Down he tumbled through wind and darkness, straight for earth. Small children across the world made their first wishes together that night: ‘Let us always find our way in the dark.’ Their secret chorus woke the Meteor just before he hit the ground. He yawned, stretched, and instead of landing, split into a thousand sparkling fragments—enough to grant every child one quiet, fearless dream.</p><p>&ldquo;Now, whenever you see a shooting star, that’s the Sleepy Meteor, keeping old promises to little ones who hope maybe, just maybe, the night will be kind this time.&rdquo;</p><hr><h3 id=the-lopsided-moon-and-the-bear>The Lopsided Moon and the Bear</h3><p>Hugo braved, &ldquo;What about the moon? It’s crooked tonight.&rdquo;</p><p>Nestor chuckled, remembering the misadventures of moons past. &ldquo;That’s because the moon isn’t nearly as serious as grown-ups let on. Some moons get up early, practice shining in the mirror, and dress up bright and round. But once in a while, the moon stays out late, gambles with a bear from the far north.</p><p>&ldquo;The Lopsided Moon wagered once that he could win a pawful of honey from Old Silverback. They played hide and seek among the Northern Lights, chasing through shifting curtains of color and cold. The moon, being all clever angles and slivers, won—barely! But ever since, when the moon looks slanted or seems to be missing a chunk, you know he’s been out with the bear again. He always comes home with a sticky tail and a sideways grin.&rdquo;</p><hr><h3 id=the-sleepwalkers-of-cloudridge>The Sleepwalkers of Cloudridge</h3><p>&ldquo;Further in, just beyond midnight,&rdquo; Nestor continued, &ldquo;if you stare at a patch of cloud right above the tallest pine, you might spot the Sleepwalkers. They wander the midnight mist, spinning stories of dreams not yet dreamt.&rdquo;</p><p>May, cuddled deeper, asked, &ldquo;Are they people?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No one’s ever sure. They’re the shadows who sneak into your room when you’re almost awake, humming lullabies that get tangled in your pillow. They polish nightmares until they shine like gemstones and then place them in stories for safe keeping.</p><p>&ldquo;If you wake up with a head full of foggy wonders—a cat with butterfly wings, a secret door behind your wardrobe—thank the Sleepwalkers. The stories they touch in passing never leave you alone.&rdquo;</p><hr><h3 id=nestors-secret>Nestor’s Secret</h3><p>Night deepened outside, the velvet sky pricked with diamond stars Nestor seemed to have summoned with his stories. The children drifted, heavy-eyed and content.</p><p>Toby, nearly asleep, mumbled, &ldquo;Where do you get the stories, Nestor?&rdquo;</p><p>Nestor smiled, gently closing the battered book. &ldquo;From you,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;From every dream and lost worry spun into the curtains, from every whispered wish. The starry night listens to you, just as odd old storytellers do. And when you listen back, the night glitters a little brighter.&rdquo;</p><p>May’s eyes grew heavy, her hand curled around the corner of the old book; Hugo yawned and rolled into a pile of quilt and blanket. Nestor sat long after they settled, gazing out at the sky.</p><p>He thought of the Whisperer, streaks of the Sleepy Meteor, and the lopsided moon still laughing somewhere beyond the pines. His stories wound quietly through the small cottage, each word a tiny aurora above the sleeping children.</p><p>He never tired of telling stories or looking up, too, hoping even a grown-up might spot last night’s wish shining back down—a promise of wonder, still undimmed, on every starry night.</p><hr><h2 id=the-end>The End</h2><p>As the hush of sleep crept over the cottage, and the embers glowed softly, the stories remained—spun between the cosmos and the soft glow of lamp-lit faces, ever waiting for new dreamers to look up and listen.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/bedtime-stories/>Bedtime Stories</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-sleepytime-collection-timeless-bedtime-stories-for-all-ages/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Sleepytime Collection: Timeless Bedtime Stories for All Ages</span>
