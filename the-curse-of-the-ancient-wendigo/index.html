Somewhere, far off, a wolf howled—brief, mournful, almost lost beneath the sound of falling snow. If anyone had been watching, they might have seen the stumble of a lone figure through the drifts, heavy canvas coat already mottled with white.</p><p>Jonas Dillard had promised himself years ago he would never return to Frostpine Woods. The forest was too thick, its secrets too old, its legends too persistent. The stories of the ancient Wendigo weren&rsquo;t just fireside banter in these parts—they were warnings, spoken with a hush and a shudder. Children were told to stay out of the trees after dark, but Jonas, in a mix of bravado and desperation, had come anyway.</p><p>His boots sank into cold powder as he trampled a faint path through the pines. Every few steps, he glanced over his shoulder, as though afraid some memory—or something worse—trailed behind. His reason for coming back was as bitter as the cold: his sister, Rebecca, was missing. Traces led to the old Miller’s cabin, where the children began whispering of a monstrous shape glimpsed flitting among the trees.</p><p>His breath steamed in the lamplight, painting him as a specter against the gloom as he trudged on. The Miller’s cabin claimed the edge of a clearing, bent and gray with age, seams packed with old moss, roof sagging under years of neglect and ice.</p><p>He hesitated on the step, his hand hovering above the frostbitten rail. Something felt wrong; the shadows pressed close, alive and attentive. But Rebecca’s scarf—striped green and gray, a relic of childhood—hung from the door latch, frozen straight.</p><p>He pushed open the door.</p><p>The inside was musty and cold, with the ancient touch of rot. Old photos, faces yellowed by time, glared from the walls. Furniture sat under dust and frost, undisturbed. But on the floor—yes, there were fresh prints, not more than an hour old.</p><p>&ldquo;Rebecca?&rdquo; His voice barely carried. The only answer: the groan of timbers settling in the wind.</p><p>Jonas moved deeper, following footprints that arced through the single room to the fireplace. There, ash smudged in odd patterns, and something else—scratches, deep gouges in the floorboards. More chilling still, a crude symbol had been chiseled into the hearthstone: a wide, fanged mouth, all jagged hunger.</p><p>He forced the chill from his bones. If this was meant to frighten him, it had succeeded. The symbol belonged to no faith he&rsquo;d ever known, but the locals spoke of ancient totems—wardings meant to keep away the Wendigo. Or, as some muttered, to call it forth.</p><p>He nearly jumped when something tapped at the window. For a heart-stopping moment, he saw the reflection of his own pale, frightened face—but then he saw the hand. Splayed, black with frostbite, the tips of the fingers sharpened almost to claws. A whisper of a face, impossibly thin and long, peered in, features twisted with starvation.</p><p>Jonas’s feet rooted to the floor. He blinked, and the thing was gone.</p><p>He staggered outside, forgetting discretion, barely hearing the way the wind seemed to cackle in delight. The trees leaned closer, the old pine trunks creaking as though they were bones. He found himself on a narrow trail illuminated only by occasional flashes of lightning.</p><p>Then he heard it—a voice, wavering, familiar.</p><p>&ldquo;Jonas.&rdquo;</p><p>He spun and saw her. Rebecca stood just beyond the reach of the clearing, her coat torn, hair matted with ice. Her skin was pale, eyes wide and haunted.</p><p>&ldquo;Rebecca!&rdquo; Relief flooded him in a rush. He stumbled toward her.</p><p>But she did not come closer. &ldquo;Don’t,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t. It’s waiting.&rdquo;</p><p>He halted, chest heaving. &ldquo;What happened? Who did this?&rdquo;</p><p>Her gaze flicked to the trees behind her, terror stark on her face. &ldquo;I saw it. I tried to run, but it finds you when you’re hungry, when you want too much. Please, Jonas, you have to leave.&rdquo;</p><p>Something shuffled in the undergrowth, a dragging, half-human sound that made his nerves shriek. Rebecca&rsquo;s eyes glistened with tears. &ldquo;No one comes to these woods for rescue. The Wendigo hungers for sorrow, for desperation.&rdquo;</p><p>The wind whipped, and Jonas heard his own name whispered on its currents. His pulse hammered with some new, primal fear.</p><p>He remembered the stories: On nights when the wind howled loudest, the Wendigo slipped through the trees unseen. It craved human flesh, yes, but more than hunger, it sought those tainted by greed, loneliness, or betrayal. It was said, too, that someone who locked eyes with it would carry its curse—a gnawing desire that could never be satisfied.</p><p>He swallowed. &ldquo;Rebecca, we’re leaving together. I’ll get us out.&rdquo;</p><p>She shook her head. Her lips were cracked, bloodless. &ldquo;I can’t. I’m already marked.&rdquo; Her fingers pressed against her heart. &ldquo;It’s inside me now. You have to go before it decides you’re hungry too.&rdquo;</p><p>Lightning flickered again. For a split second, Jonas saw another shape looming behind Rebecca—a monstrous outline with antlers that scraped the sky and fingers like crooked knives.</p><p>He screamed her name, running toward her.</p><p>She faded as he approached, her form growing translucent, her eyes haunted and sorrowful. He skidded to a halt, realizing with horror that she was already gone—a memory, or perhaps an echo, left behind by the ancient curse.</p><p>The trees exploded into motion. The Wendigo stepped from the darkness: a gaunt, towering figure with a skull-like head crowned by twisted horns. Its mouth gaped open, a dark abyss, and the sound it made was not a growl or a snarl but a sigh, empty as winter.</p><p>Jonas backed away, stifling a sob. He stumbled over roots and into snowdrifts, hearing the creature’s breath growing closer. The wind, like a hundred voices, drove him on.</p><p>He ran, memories swirling: his betrayal of Rebecca years ago, his greed, his unresolved guilt. He realized—the Wendigo knew. It hunted not the body, but the spirit crippled by shame and longing. He was prey.</p><p>He nearly collapsed in the snow, but a flash of green and gray caught his eye—Rebecca’s scarf again, wound around a gnarly branch. He snatched it, clenching it to his chest. Her scent lingered, faintly, beneath the frost.</p><p>The curse had rules, he remembered. It could only claim you if you surrendered to it, gave in to that hunger for what was lost. He forced himself to remember happier days, dragging forth every warm memory he could muster: hours playing with Rebecca by the brook, her laughter under spring sunlight, the scent of pine needles and loam. He wrapped the scarf tighter, whispering her name—not as a curse, but as hope.</p><p>Behind him, the Wendigo screamed—a sound of furious hunger denied.</p><p>He stumbled onward, never looking back, determined to keep moving while those memories still burned bright in his chest. With every step away from despair, the shrieking faded. By the time the sky began to lighten and the trees thinned, Jonas fell to his knees, alone.</p><p>He awoke at the forest’s edge as the sun struggled through clouds, the scarf still pressed to his heart. Rebecca was gone, consumed by the ancient curse, but he had escaped with more than just his life—he had a chance to mourn her without surrendering to despair.</p><p>But even as the snow thawed in the weeks that followed, Jonas knew Frostpine Woods had changed him. The curse of the ancient Wendigo wasn’t just a beast that walked the trees; it was hunger and sorrow, always waiting for an invitation. And sometimes, in the bleakest hours of the night, he heard the wind howl and wondered if its shadow would ever truly let him go.</p><hr><p>Frostpine residents spoke in whispers, passing the warning to their children: The Wendigo prowls for the lost and the lonely, for those who allow regret to hollow them out. Each storm, each howl beyond the trees, reminded them of what lurks beneath desperation.</p><p>Only hope, burning steady, offered salvation from the ancient curse. And so Jonas, each year, tied Rebecca’s scarf at the edge of the wood—a token for the missing, a warning for the living, and a reminder that even in the grip of the oldest monsters, not all who enter are lost forever.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/mystical-creatures/>Mystical Creatures</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-crystal-forests-guardians-a-saga-of-unforgettable-fabled-equines/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Crystal Forest's Guardians: A Saga of Unforgettable Fabled Equines</span>
