Being colleagues, they seldom spoke outside of the mental health clinic where they worked. With bated breath, Samantha picked up the call.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Sam, you won&rsquo;t believe what just came into the clinic,&rdquo; Dr. Martin began. His voice shook with excitement.</p><p>Samantha took a sip of her coffee, bracing herself for the unexpected surprise. &ldquo;Well, spill it,&rdquo; she said, her curiosity piqued.</p><p>&ldquo;We got this new patient, a man who claims to have a… a <em>bottomless</em> mind,&rdquo; Dr. Martin said, emphasizing the words. Samantha let out a chuckle, but Dr. Martin quickly added, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m dead-serious here, Sam. This isn&rsquo;t one of our usual eccentric cases.&rdquo;</p><p>That intrigued Samantha. She grabbed a notepad, preparing herself for their new patient. &ldquo;Alright, I&rsquo;m listening.&rdquo;</p><p>Over the next few days, Dr. Martin shared intermittent details about the enigma of a man they both had taken on as a case. This man had loss of memories, foggy recollections of the past, and gaps of time he couldn&rsquo;t fill in. To most, this would be a common issue, but this wasn&rsquo;t just any memory loss - he insisted there wasn&rsquo;t an end to his memories, that his mind went on and on, never toying with the idea of a termination.</p><p>Days morphed into weeks, and the mysteries of the man&rsquo;s life unraveled bit by bit. Revealing the layers of his life, piece by piece, Samantha felt herself falling into the rabbit hole of his story. But something was off. There was a quality to the man&rsquo;s story that resonated with her - a bizarre, fugitive nature. Samantha became increasingly interested in understanding the intricate puzzle of his mind.</p><p>One day, she decided to delve deeper, attempting to locate the source of his puzzling assertion of a bottomless mind. She asked him about his early childhood, digging deep into his past for answers.</p><p>The man, named Mr. Thomas, hesitated for a moment before replying. &ldquo;I told my story countless times, yet…&rdquo; He paused, his eyes searching for a situation that could encapsulate the very essence of his condition. &ldquo;Do you know what it&rsquo;s like to question your own identity?&rdquo;</p><p>Samantha nodded. This was a common affliction in her profession, but Mr. Thomas&rsquo; perspective was unique.</p><p>Mr. Thomas continued, &ldquo;When I was seven years old, I saw a lightning strike the ground near me. That day, I found myself flying, soaring uncontrollably into the sky. Everything from my perspective was brewing, transforming, swirling, and expanding. I spiraled up into the sky faster than I could think, and in a sudden, shocking moment, I slammed against my own bedroom ceiling. I crashed through it and landed on the floor, disoriented and confused.&rdquo;</p><p>His story ended. But the questions lingered. Samantha felt a profound sense of unease. This wasn&rsquo;t just about his memories &ndash; it was about his very existence and the sense of self.</p><p>A couple weeks later, Samantha found herself intensely studying Mr. Thomas. As he spoke about his past, she noticed how the more he spoke, the more he swirled in an uncontrollable daze, his mind expanding with every word. There was an odd, recurrent pattern to his behavior. Mr. Thomas seemed to be spiraling into a deeper mystery.</p><p>The shock of this realization struck Samantha as she shared her findings with Dr. Martin. She played back the recording of Mr. Thomas recounting his past experiences. &ldquo;Do you hear it? The frequency in his speech - it changes every time he recounts his past,&rdquo; Samantha revealed.</p><p>A silence fell between the two as they looked at each other, their faces a blend of shock and realization. Then, Dr. Martin broke the silence: &ldquo;Samantha, I think we need to face this head-on.&rdquo;</p><p>With the weight of their new hypothesis, Samantha nervously anticipated delving into the heart of Mr. Thomas&rsquo; past. As they settled into their next session, an unsettling thought nagged her - could Mr. Thomas really be unlocking the untapped secrets of human existence?</p><h2 id=acknowledgments>Acknowledgments</h2><p>A huge thank you to all those who have given me guidance and motivation throughout my journey.
