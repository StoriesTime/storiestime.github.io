For years, I thought it was just a part of me, something I couldn’t avoid or control. But, as time went on, I realized that living with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) wasn’t just a personal quirk—it was something far deeper, far more consuming.</p><p>I was 12 when the first inklings of OCD began to manifest, but it wasn’t until my teenage years that I truly understood what it was. At first, it seemed like harmless habits, little rituals that I thought would help me feel secure or safe in an uncertain world. But it quickly escalated. I remember the feeling of needing to check the door repeatedly before I could leave the house. It wasn’t just about making sure it was locked—I felt like if I didn’t check it at least 10 times, something bad would happen.</p><p>It wasn’t as though I consciously believed something terrible would occur if I didn’t do it; rather, it was the overwhelming anxiety that would rise within me, like a pressure building up inside my chest, until the only way to relieve it was to go back and check. And once I checked, the feeling would subside—only to return a few minutes later, stronger than before. The need to repeat the action would intensify, as though my mind was training me to expect that moment of panic again.</p><p>In high school, the rituals became more ingrained. It wasn’t just the door anymore. It was my hands. If I didn’t wash them a certain number of times or use soap in exactly the right order, I couldn’t leave the house. The same thoughts replayed in my mind, relentless and unyielding. “What if I don’t wash my hands properly? What if something terrible happens because I didn’t do it right?” This cycle repeated itself with greater frequency, invading every part of my life.</p><p>The more I tried to suppress the compulsion, the stronger it became. I was trapped in a loop that I couldn’t escape, and I became increasingly frustrated with myself. I wanted to be like everyone else. I wanted to go about my day without feeling the need to touch everything three times or check the stove for the 20th time before leaving the house. But no matter how hard I tried to ignore the thoughts, they wouldn’t go away.</p><p>By the time I reached college, my OCD had infiltrated almost every aspect of my life. It wasn’t just checking or washing. It was counting steps, repeating phrases to myself, arranging my belongings in exact symmetry. Every task, no matter how trivial, became an ordeal that I couldn’t control. The weight of it all became too much to carry. My friends began to notice, and I felt ashamed, as though I was broken in some fundamental way. I was embarrassed to tell anyone about it. How could I explain something so irrational, so debilitating, to people who didn’t understand?</p><p>I lived in isolation, avoiding social situations because the fear of judgment was overwhelming. I became quiet, withdrawn, always trying to manage my thoughts in private, hoping that no one would notice how out of control I felt inside. But the rituals never stopped. They had become my coping mechanism, the only way I could feel some semblance of order in a world that felt chaotic and unpredictable. I remember waking up in the middle of the night, drenched in sweat, because I had somehow convinced myself that I hadn’t checked the locks before bed, or that I hadn’t washed my hands correctly before eating.</p><p>But even as I struggled, I began to hear whispers of something that could help. Friends and family who had noticed my distress gently encouraged me to seek professional help. The idea of therapy terrified me. I had spent so much of my life trying to hide my OCD, to keep it contained in the shadows where no one could see it. What if therapy didn’t work? What if I was beyond help?</p><p>Finally, after months of inner turmoil, I made an appointment with a therapist. It was one of the hardest things I had ever done. Walking into that office, I felt exposed, as though I was about to reveal a part of myself that I had kept hidden for so long. But my therapist was kind, patient, and nonjudgmental. Over time, she helped me understand that OCD wasn’t a reflection of who I was as a person. It was an illness, one that could be managed with the right tools and support.</p><p>The first step in therapy was to confront my fears head-on. My therapist encouraged me to do something that seemed impossible: to resist my compulsions. At first, it was as though my mind rebelled against the very thought. I would sit in a room, the anxiety building to a point where I could hardly breathe. My mind screamed at me to check, to wash, to count—but I had to resist.</p><p>It wasn’t easy. The anxiety didn’t go away after a few minutes; it often lingered for hours, wearing me down, trying to force me into action. But slowly, over time, I began to realize that the anxiety didn’t last forever. It would peak, and then it would subside. Little by little, I was able to break free from the cycle, to make it through a day without giving in to the compulsions.</p><p>One of the most significant tools my therapist introduced was exposure and response prevention (ERP). It involved intentionally exposing myself to situations that triggered my OCD, and then refraining from performing the rituals. I remember one exercise where I had to leave the house without checking the door—something I had never been able to do before without feeling like something terrible would happen. The first time I did it, I felt like I was walking on a tightrope. Every inch of me screamed to go back and check. But I didn’t. And as the minutes passed, the world didn’t end. I hadn’t locked the door “correctly,” and yet everything was fine.</p><p>It felt like a breakthrough, a small victory in a battle that had raged for years. But I also understood that recovery wasn’t linear. There were days when the anxiety returned with a vengeance. There were days when I felt overwhelmed and defeated. But I learned that those days didn’t define me. I wasn’t a failure just because my OCD had a grip on me. It didn’t mean I was hopeless or broken. It meant that I was human.</p><p>Over time, with therapy, medication, and a great deal of personal work, I began to feel more in control of my life. My OCD still exists; it’s a part of me that I continue to manage. But I don’t let it define who I am anymore. I don’t let it dictate my actions, and I don’t let it steal my joy.</p><p>Living with OCD is not something that can be “fixed” overnight. It’s a journey, one that takes patience, perseverance, and a lot of self-compassion. I’ve learned that I don’t have to fight my OCD alone. There are people who understand, people who are willing to walk with me through the hardest moments.</p><p>For anyone living with OCD, I want to say this: you are not alone. It’s okay to seek help. It’s okay to not have all the answers. You are more than your thoughts and compulsions, and you deserve to live a life that is full, meaningful, and free of shame.</p><p>There is no magic cure for OCD, but there is hope. There is help. And most importantly, there is the possibility of reclaiming your life—one small step at a time.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/mental-health-and-psychology/>Mental Health and Psychology</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/living-with-ocd-true-stories-from-the-frontlines/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Living with OCD: True Stories from the Frontlines</span>
