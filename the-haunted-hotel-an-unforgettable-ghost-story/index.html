A sense of foreboding lingered in the air as Ethan pulled his car up to the gates of the Hollowbrook Hotel. It had been a long drive, and he was tired, desperate to find a place to rest after hours on the winding roads. The hotel stood at the edge of the forest, an imposing structure built from old, weathered stone that seemed almost alive in the mist.</p><p>Ethan hesitated for a moment before he opened the door, the cool wind sweeping through the car. The sign hanging above the gate read, &ldquo;Hollowbrook Hotel - A Place of Mystery.&rdquo; The letters were faded and worn, as though the hotel hadn&rsquo;t seen guests in years. But the road had been leading him here, and there was nowhere else to go.</p><p>As he stepped onto the gravel path that led to the entrance, the grand double doors swung open by themselves, creaking loudly as they moved. The warmth of the lobby greeted him, the faint scent of wood and musk filling the air. A small desk sat in the corner, and behind it, a man with graying hair and a somber expression stood waiting.</p><p>&ldquo;Welcome to the Hollowbrook,&rdquo; the man said in a voice that was both welcoming and unsettling. &ldquo;I trust you’ve had a pleasant journey?&rdquo;</p><p>Ethan nodded, his eyes scanning the room. The walls were adorned with faded portraits, and the old chandeliers overhead cast a dim, eerie glow. The hotel was quiet—too quiet—except for the soft ticking of a grandfather clock in the corner.</p><p>&ldquo;I’m Ethan,&rdquo; he introduced himself, stepping forward to check in.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; the man replied. &ldquo;Your room is ready. Room 213. Up the stairs, second door on the left.&rdquo;</p><p>Ethan was about to ask about the history of the hotel, but something about the man’s cold gaze made him hesitate. He nodded silently and grabbed his key. The strange stillness of the place weighed heavily on him as he ascended the narrow staircase, each step echoing in the quiet of the building.</p><p>When he reached the second floor, the door to room 213 loomed before him. It was an old wooden door with intricate carvings, and the brass number &ldquo;213&rdquo; was tarnished with age. He turned the key and stepped inside, the door groaning on its hinges as it opened.</p><p>The room was just as he had expected—antiquated and oddly charming, with heavy furniture and thick velvet curtains. A large four-poster bed sat in the center, draped with a deep red comforter. The walls were lined with wallpaper that had long since lost its vibrancy. Despite the dust that lingered in the air, the room seemed peaceful, almost serene.</p><p>Ethan placed his bag on the bed and sighed, his exhaustion catching up with him. He decided to unpack later; for now, he just wanted a hot shower and a moment to relax. As he stepped into the bathroom, the water in the shower sputtered for a moment before it turned hot. The sound of the water was soothing, washing away the fatigue from his long journey.</p><p>But then, something strange happened. A whisper. At first, Ethan thought it was the sound of the water, but as the minutes passed, the whisper grew clearer. It was a voice, faint but distinct. He froze, his hand still on the shower knob. The voice seemed to come from behind the walls.</p><p>&ldquo;Ethan&mldr;&rdquo;</p><p>His heart skipped a beat. He quickly turned off the shower, the cold air hitting his skin. He stood still, straining his ears to listen. The whisper came again.</p><p>&ldquo;Help me, Ethan&mldr;&rdquo;</p><p>A chill ran down his spine. There was no one else in the room—he was sure of it. His eyes darted around the bathroom, looking for any sign of movement, but everything was still. The voice echoed in his mind, its urgency sending a shiver through him.</p><p>Swallowing his fear, he stepped out of the bathroom and walked cautiously toward the bed. He picked up his phone to call the front desk, but there was no signal. The room, it seemed, was cut off from the outside world.</p><p>The whispering grew louder, more frantic. &ldquo;Ethan, please&mldr; they are watching&mldr;&rdquo;</p><p>Ethan’s breath quickened, and his pulse raced as his surroundings seemed to grow darker. The temperature in the room dropped, and his breath fogged in front of him. The curtains fluttered, though there was no wind. Then, as if summoned by his fear, a shadow passed by the door. It was quick, just a blur in the corner of his eye.</p><p>He turned toward the door, his heart pounding in his chest. He wasn’t alone.</p><p>There was a knock. Three sharp raps that echoed through the room.</p><p>&ldquo;Ethan&mldr; you shouldn’t have come here,&rdquo; a voice whispered from the other side of the door.</p><p>Panic set in. He wasn’t sure whether it was the voice of the man from the front desk, or something far darker, but he knew he needed to leave. He rushed to the door, flung it open, and was met with nothing but the eerie silence of the hallway.</p><p>The hotel felt different now. It was no longer just old and abandoned—it was alive, and it was watching him.</p><p>A cold gust of wind swept down the corridor, extinguishing the faint glow of the wall sconces. Ethan’s breath caught in his throat as he saw movement at the end of the hallway. A figure, draped in a white gown, stood at the far end, watching him with hollow, empty eyes.</p><p>Her skin was as pale as the moon, her hair long and dark, cascading over her shoulders. She seemed to float rather than walk, her feet never quite touching the ground. Her lips parted, and though no words were spoken, Ethan could feel her gaze piercing through him, pulling him toward her.</p><p>He backed away, the room behind him seeming to close in. He was no longer sure what was real and what was his imagination. But before he could react, the figure began to move toward him.</p><p>He turned and ran, his feet pounding against the old wood of the hallway. The walls seemed to stretch and bend as if the hotel itself was alive, warping to trap him inside.</p><p>Desperation surged through him. He needed to get out. He reached the staircase, but the moment his foot touched the first step, a heavy thud echoed through the building, like something heavy had fallen above.</p><p>The whispering grew louder, now a cacophony of voices, all pleading, all begging.</p><p>“Help us… Ethan… Don’t leave…”</p><p>He didn’t know what to do, where to go. But he couldn’t stay here any longer. With every ounce of strength, he bolted down the stairs, his legs screaming in pain as he ran.</p><p>When he reached the front door, he yanked it open, only to find himself facing the fog outside. But this time, the fog had changed. It wasn’t the soft mist that had greeted him when he first arrived; now it was thick, swirling, and full of shapes.</p><p>He stepped out into the cold night air, breathing heavily, but before he could take another step, he heard the voice again. This time, it was right behind him.</p><p>&ldquo;Ethan, you can’t leave.&rdquo;</p><p>He whipped around, but the figure—the woman in white—was gone. The air was thick with an unnatural stillness.</p><p>But the door to the Hollowbrook Hotel slowly creaked shut behind him, as if closing the door on any escape.</p><p>Ethan didn’t look back. He didn’t need to. He knew the truth now: the Hollowbrook Hotel wasn’t just a place of mystery—it was a place of torment. A place where the past lingered, where the lost souls of those who had stayed too long still roamed. And they would never let him forget.</p><p>For weeks after, Ethan tried to erase the experience from his mind, but the whispers followed him. They taunted him in his dreams, pulling him back into the grasp of the Hollowbrook Hotel, a place from which no one truly escaped.</p><p>And the hotel stood, waiting for the next traveler, the next soul to wander through its doors.</p><p>The Hollowbrook Hotel would never forget.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/ghost-stories/>Ghost Stories</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-haunted-forest-a-collection-of-ghostly-tales/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Haunted Forest: A Collection of Ghostly Tales</span>
