The ship was a marvel of modern engineering, boasting 16 watertight compartments that could supposedly keep it afloat even if four of them were breached.
On board were some of the most prominent people of the time, including millionaires, politicians, and royalty. Captain Edward Smith, a seasoned sailor with over 20 years of experience, was at the helm. His first officer, William Murdoch, was a seasoned navigator with a reputation for being one of the best in the business.
As the Titanic made its way through the English Channel, the passengers and crew alike were excited and optimistic about the journey ahead. The ship's contraptions were the latest in maritime technology, and it was equipped with some of the most advanced safety features of its time. The passengers were received in grand style, with the crew eager to please and ensure they had the best experience possible.
However, there were rumors of problems with the ship's builders, Harland and Wolff, as they had recently altered the ship's original design. Engineer Arthur Henry Rostron, the chief engineer of the ship, had previously expressed concerns about the structural integrity of the ship, citing the sheer size of the vessel and the potential for massive instability.
Despite these misgivings, the Titanic's builders argued that their innovative solution to the lateral strength problem made the ship the most waterproof vessel to date. Captain Smith himself was satisfied with the vessel's suitability, expressing confidence in its stability and ability.
All seemed well, hence, it was eight days ahead of schedule to New York City when an iceberg was spotted at 11:40 pm on the night of April 14th, while the ship was travelling at its full speed of 22 knots. The reports that emerged confirmed that the Titanic was headed towards the iceberg, but it was not moving quickly enough to avoid it.
While there were potentially 1356 individuals on board, they could have used a few bits and pieces to improve their chances of survival - signaling equipment, Torpedo nets etc. The hysterical clamoring of officers to receive urgent assistance produced ineffective ineffective radio loss sentiment seemed persuasive - Ice warning, High alert. Taking the first steps proved tricky!
