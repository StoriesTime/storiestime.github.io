The Spartan king, Leonidas, stood at the forefront, surrounded by his 300 handpicked hoplites, the finest fighters in all of Greece. Their mission was to hold off the invading Persian army, led by the dreaded King Xerxes, and give their homeland a fighting chance against the feared empire.
Leonidas gazed out at the towering cliffs that flanked the pass, his eyes squinting against the blinding glare of the sun.

The Ten Thousand Spartans
Meanwhile, back in Sparta, the people were in a state of high anxiety. The news of the Persian invasion had reached the 10,000 Spartans, who rallied behind King Leonidas. They felt an immense sense of pride that their king was standing up to the invading force and honored his legendary bravery.
Among them was a young warrior named Theodoros, who had grown up listening to stories about Thermopylae's fabled history.

It was a sweltering August morning in 480 BCE when King Leonidas of Sparta led his 300 elite hoplites into the narrow pass of Thermopylae, Greece. Their mission was to delay the invading Persian army, led by King Xerxes, and give their homeland a fighting chance against the feared empire.
Leonidas gazed out at the towering cliffs that flanked the pass, his eyes squinting against the blinding glare of the sun. The defenders of Thermopylae were outnumbered, but they were determined to make every drop of water count. The Spartan general knew that his men needed to stall for time, to allow the Greeks to regroup and prepare for the impending battle.
As the first Persian scouts appeared on the horizon, Leonidas gave the order to take up positions. The Greeks formed a phalanx, their long spears locked together, creating an impenetrable wall of steel. The Persians, with their vast numbers and cavalry, charged forward, but the Greeks held firm, their shields interlocked and their spears protruding like a forest of deadly spikes.
The battle raged on for hours, with the Persians trying to outflank the Greeks, but the defenders of Thermopylae were too well-prepared. They had carefully chosen the narrowest point of the pass, where the cliffs rose steeply on one side and the sea stretched out on the other. Any attempt by the Persians to outflank the Greeks would be met with crushing force, as they would have to fight their way up steep cliffs or wade through the cold waters of the Aegean Sea.
Despite being vastly outnumbered, the Greek phalanx stood firm, cutting down wave after wave of Persian invaders. Leonidas himself fought bravely, his spear slicing through the press of enemy soldiers, his shield protecting him from the hail of arrows and spears that rained down upon him.
But even the most heroic of warriors cannot hold back an army of tens of thousands forever. As the sun began to set on the second day of the battle, the Greeks found themselves surrounded by a sea of enemy soldiers, their only escape route cut off by the rising tide of the Persian army.
Leonidas, foreseeing the inevitable, sent a messenger to a nearby slope, where a force of roughly 700 Thespians, part of the original 7,000-strong force that had marched with Leonidas, was waiting for the signal to attack.
