His family was poor; his father, Thomas Lincoln, worked as a carpenter and farmer, while his mother, Nancy Lincoln, took care of the household and their children. Despite their humble background, the young Abraham was always known to be industrious, inquisitive, and ambitious.</p><p>As a child, Lincoln had limited access to formal education, but that didn&rsquo;t stop him from developing a love for reading. Whenever he could, he would borrow books and newspapers, devouring every word, soaking up knowledge and wisdom like a sponge. He developed a great love for literature, particularly the works of William Shakespeare, which he often recited from memory.</p><p>In 1816, the Lincoln family decided to relocate to neighboring Indiana in search of better opportunities. They arrived in the newly formed Knox County, where Thomas Lincoln purchased an acre of land that would be home to their new log cabin dwelling.</p><p>The harsh realities of frontier life forged young Abraham into a tough and resourceful adventurer. Lincoln was a trader, a hunter, and a farmer – always making and doing, learning about business, land, and people.</p><p>During this time, he met a young woman named Mary Owens. Although they were not officially engaged, it was widely assumed they would marry. However, after visiting her family in Kentucky, Lincoln changed his mind and broke off the relationship. It is said that his friends later got him a subscription to a Ladies&rsquo; Novel-Reading Circle, which may have provided some closure or distraction from the lost love.</p><p>In 1830, Lincoln&rsquo;s mother died, leaving him and his sister Sarah to care for their father, who battled periods of mental illness. Determined to make something of himself, Lincoln moved to nearby Gentryville and secured employment with his local businessman and storekeeper John Hanks. Here, he embraced the skills of surveying, carpentry, and blacksmithing on set with so many others, and he made contacts that proved vital on his later journey to greatness.</p><p>However, destiny had a different path for the young man. In 1834, a dispute over land ownership led to a fatal fight and invoked Whig politics in New Salem. Lincoln found himself backed against a wall by his opponent, but luckily, his side won the fight. This confrontation prompted Lincoln to make the decision to pursue a legal education and enter politics. Lincoln prevailed in this event, and it may be seen as an indication of his future successful political career.</p><p>Lincoln moved to Jacksonville, Illinois, in 1836 and began studying law, although he had no formal education beyond the equivalent of eighth grade. He apprenticed under the firm Stephen T. Logan and Sons and continued his relentless self-education through reading law books. His perseverance paid off, and he passed the legal bar exam in 1836.</p><p>In 1839, Lincoln married Mary Todd, a well-educated and sophisticated woman from a wealthy and influential Kentucky family, further expanding his connections to the world of politics and social elites.</p><p>His political career took off in 1846 when he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives as a Whig Party member. Throughout his political career, he was known for his powerful speeches and his unwavering stance on the abolition of slavery. When the Civil War erupted in 1861 after the secession of the southern states, Lincoln was elected as the 16th president of the United States.</p><p>His administration laid the foundation for the abolition of slavery with the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 and the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment in 1865. He rallied a divided nation and worked tirelessly to preserve the Union until his tragic assassination on April 14, 1865, just days after the war had ended, by the Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth.</p><p>Abraham Lincoln remains an icon of American history and an embodiment of the American Dream. His life story is a testament to the power of determination, perseverance, and the pursuit of knowledge. Lincoln&rsquo;s humble beginnings and his rise to greatness stand as a shining example of what is possible when a person refuses to accept life&rsquo;s limitations and steadfastly pursues their goals.</p><p><strong>Keywords</strong>: Abraham Lincoln, biography, American history, American Dream, humble beginnings, political career, Whig Party, US House of Representatives, Civil War, Emancipation Proclamation, Thirteenth Amendment.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/historical-figures/>Historical Figures</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/from-farm-boy-to-father-of-invention-thomas-edisons-inventive-journey/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>From Farm Boy to Father of Invention: Thomas Edison's Inventive Journey</span>
