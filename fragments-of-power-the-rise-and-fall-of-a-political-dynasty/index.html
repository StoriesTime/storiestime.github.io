The story of the El'gorin dynasty began hundreds of years ago, when the great leader, Arin El'gorin, united the warring tribes and forged a mighty empire. His descendants would go on to rule Azsar for generations, their power and influence growing with each passing year.
The El'gorins were known for their cunning diplomacy and military prowess. They forged alliances with neighboring kingdoms, expanding Azsar's borders and establishing trade routes that brought wealth and prosperity to the people. However, with great power comes great corruption, and the El'gorins were no exception. As the years passed, their thirst for power and control led to a gradual decline in their moral character.
#The Rise of the El'gorins#
Arin El'gorin's grandson, Ryker, was a master strategist who strengthened the empire's military and expanded its borders through a series of well-planned campaigns. However, his success was not without cost. He incurred the wrath of his brother, Kael, who resented Ryker's favoritism and felt overlooked for the throne. The brothers' bitter rivalry would set the stage for the eventual downfall of the El'gorin dynasty.
Ryker's subsequent wars of expansion brought great wealth and territory to Azsar, but his methods were increasingly brutal and ruthless. He discounted the lives of his enemies, often ordering massacres and enslavements to crush potential threats. His brutal methods, however, earned him enemies who would later be instrumental in his downfall.
#Strife and Sabotage#
As Ryker's brutal methods brought Azsar fame and fortune, his brother Kael seethed with resentment. After a secret agreement with a rival kingdom, Kael launched a surprise coup against Ryker. The coup was initially successful, but Ryker proved a formidable foe, rallying his loyal forces and waging a brutal counterattack.
The ensuing civil war left the empire weakened and on the brink of collapse. Neighboring kingdoms, sensing an opportunity, began to conspire against Azsar. Kael, now firmly in power, branded his brother Ryker a tyrant and suggested he was plotting a return to power, thereby convincing multiple groups and kingdoms to support his claim to the throne.
#Descent into Madness and an Order at Breaking Point#
In time, it transpired that Ryker had made cunning enemies and suspects rather than faithful allies. Thousands of secret murdered fled into slave-holding realms contrary to what Arin hoped for. Through the equations of mistrust and destroyed cohorts and end results, Ryker faced serious losses. Desire for something great could bring internal party losses overall.
Without a clear purpose or direction, the empire began to crumble. Vast regions broke away, plunging Azsar into a terrible period of civil war and invasions. Desperation gripped the people as once-adored leaders plummeted to the dark and changed lights of careless ambition. Enemies at the Big-bond account challenged every warrior, then promised droves and accidental financing. Their beneficence foiled when singular are flawed and if Order even patronized rivalry lost much heavy wrecks.
