An outpost forgotten by both time and those who once claimed it, the site lay at the heart of a land that swallowed men whole, sparing few from its darkness.</p><p>Russell Harthorne was no stranger to wild lands. A former captain turned explorer, his life had been defined by his insatiable thirst for the unknown. But as the keel of his small steamboat scraped against the muddy embankment of the river, his confidence wilted against the oppressive weight of the place. The jungle was suffocating, its dense foliage seeming to surround and judge him with silent disapproval, as though it knew more about his reasons for coming than he did himself.</p><p>He stepped ashore, his leather boots displacing wet earth in a satisfying crunch that betrayed more enthusiasm than he felt. His guide, a wiry man named Obeka with piercing, unyielding eyes, motioned for him to stay close.</p><p>&ldquo;Captain, this place,&rdquo; Obeka said, not for the first time, &ldquo;it does not welcome men like us.&rdquo;</p><p>“We’re only passing through,” Russell replied, more for himself than for his guide, his voice firmer than his waning resolve. But they both knew it was a lie.</p><hr><p>The purpose of the journey wasn’t one of discovery but of extraction. Russell had been hired by an influential trading company to retrieve what they called a &ldquo;former associate,&rdquo; a man named Victor Rhodes. Once hailed as an ambitious and efficient agent of the firm, Rhodes had established himself deeper into the jungle than anyone had dared before. The riches he sent back were unmatched in scale, feeding the company’s insatiable appetite for ivory and other treasures. But then all communication from him ceased. Whispers of his madness began to leak back to port towns, along with unsettling tales of his dominion over tribes that revered or feared him as a god.</p><p>The reward for Rhodes&rsquo; return—alive, ideally—was substantial. The penalty for failure, however, was unspoken but palpable.</p><p>As Russell and Obeka trudged deeper into the overgrowth, the forest seemed to close in on itself, the trail increasingly choked by entangling roots and vines. There was no wind here, yet the trees groaned like an ancient chorus, their complaints amplifying Russell&rsquo;s unease. Each step felt heavier than the last, as if the land itself sought to claim them.</p><hr><p>By the third day, there was little room in Russell&rsquo;s mind for conversation. The welcome hum of monotony that comes from travel had been replaced with dread, painted in every shadow that danced across the path. Obeka led on, his steps purposeful yet cautious, his machete slicing through stubborn vegetation only when absolutely necessary. Every so often, Obeka would pause, his head tilted as though listening to an unheard frequency, his grip tightening around the hilt of the blade.</p><p>&ldquo;What now?&rdquo; Russell asked after one such pause, though his voice carried none of its accustomed authority.</p><p>&ldquo;There is movement,&rdquo; replied Obeka in a low tone.</p><p>&ldquo;Animals?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Perhaps,” said Obeka, leaving the captain unsatisfied.</p><p>It wasn’t long before their first real encounter. Around a bend in the trail, what once might have been a makeshift camp came into view. The lean-to structures had collapsed, their wood rotted and splintered. Fire pits lay cold, choked with moss, their stones darkened with soot and—strangely—ashless. But the unusual silence was what struck Russell the hardest. There were no human remnants here. No footprints. No tools. Just the undeniable sense that something terrible had unfolded and been swallowed whole by the earth.</p><p>Russell turned to Obeka but found his guide&rsquo;s gaze fixed on the surrounding woodlands. Obeka’s lips barely moved as he whispered, &ldquo;Rhodes has invited spirits into this place.&rdquo;</p><p>Russell frowned. &ldquo;Spirits?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The men who came to find him lost two things: their purpose and themselves. That is how men become spirits.&rdquo;</p><p>He wanted to wave off Obeka&rsquo;s warning, but the words weighed on him. In this place, even the absurd had the ring of plausibility.</p><hr><p>They arrived at Rhodes’ so-called &ldquo;station&rdquo; at dusk three weeks into their trek. It was not what Russell expected, though in hindsight his expectations had been naive. The place looked less like an outpost and more like a temple to excess. Faded banners, tribal carvings, and once-valuable trinkets adorned every surface in a chaotic testament to Rhodes’ conquest of the land and, perhaps, his mind. A few emaciated figures moved about the structure’s perimeter, their heads low, their purpose unclear.</p><p>&ldquo;Is the great Victor Rhodes here?&rdquo; Russell muttered to himself, uncertain whether he hoped the man was or wasn’t.</p><p>Obeka remained silent, though his subtle withdrawal behind Russell spoke volumes.</p><p>No announcement of their arrival was needed. A pale figure stepped through the doorway of the largest structure, his body frail yet his presence commanding. Victor Rhodes stood before them, clad in disheveled clothing adorned with beads and feathers caked in grime. The eyes that held Russell’s gaze were empty yet alight with a consuming intensity. It was at once the visage of a man and a creature that had long since shed its humanity.</p><p>&ldquo;Captain Harthorne,&rdquo; Rhodes said, his voice honeyed and cold. &ldquo;The Company sends its hellhound to fetch me, then? Or are you here to join the fold?&rdquo;</p><p>Russell stepped forward cautiously, suppressing the instinct to recoil. &ldquo;I’m here to take you out of this place, Rhodes. Alive, preferably.&rdquo;</p><p>Rhodes let out a laugh—high and sharp, like knives falling onto stone. &ldquo;Take me? Out of here?&rdquo; He motioned with an almost theatrical flourish at his surroundings. &ldquo;Out of what, exactly? Freedom? Power? Truth? Tell me, Captain, does the world you serve offer any of these things?&rdquo;</p><p>Russell felt the sting of those words but refused to indulge them. &ldquo;What kind of power is this? You’re alone in the darkness with nothing but ruins.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ruins are not empty,&rdquo; Rhodes said, stepping forward. &ldquo;They are filled with what remains, long after the pretense has been burned away. Come. Let me show you what lingers when the lies wash off.&rdquo;</p><hr><p>Rhodes’ descent into the jungle’s depths had clearly unbound his mind, but there was something about his words—more than their sheer fluidity—that struck Russell in a way he couldn’t completely dismiss. He had initially feared madness, but as the night deepened into its thickest shade, he began to suspect something even more troubling: clarity. Rhodes’ charisma was dangerous, not because it lacked logic, but because it twisted the truth to its will.</p><p>“We are all villains, Captain,” Rhodes had murmured over their tense but intoxicating conversations. “The jungle strips the mask first. Then it lets you play.”</p><p>Russell didn’t sleep that night. He watched Obeka and the others lingering by the dim light of a fire, their faces waxen from tension. Rhodes didn’t seem to sleep, either, moving through the settlement like a ghost, speaking to himself or perhaps to the spirits Obeka had warned about.</p><p>Russell knew where this was going. The man wouldn’t leave willingly. He’d have to choose—the Company’s demands, or his own survival. With every passing hour, he feared he already knew which decision would prevail.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/villains-and-antagonists/>Villains and Antagonists</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/grim-intentions-inside-the-mind-of-a-mastermind/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Grim Intentions: Inside the Mind of a Mastermind</span>
