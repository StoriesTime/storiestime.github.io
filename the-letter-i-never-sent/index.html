I had always thought that writing a letter would bring closure, or at the very least, provide a sense of relief. But I never sent it. I couldn’t. And maybe that was the point.</p><p>I had known Sarah for years. We met when we were both fresh out of college, brimming with hopes and dreams. It was one of those moments in life where you instantly connect with someone. You know that feeling? The kind where you can talk for hours about anything and everything, and the world around you fades into oblivion. That was us. We became fast friends, and over time, I realized I was falling in love with her.</p><p>At first, I didn’t want to admit it. I didn’t want to risk ruining our friendship, so I kept my feelings locked away, only allowing them to surface in fleeting moments. It was easier that way. The thought of telling her seemed terrifying. What if it didn’t go as I imagined? What if it ruined everything? I convinced myself that it was better to stay silent and keep my feelings hidden.</p><p>Years went by. We shared countless experiences, from late-night conversations to quiet moments of mutual understanding. Our bond only deepened, yet I never found the courage to speak the words I had rehearsed in my mind a thousand times. We both had our share of relationships—some serious, some fleeting—but Sarah always seemed to be there, a constant in my life. I became content with the idea that we would always be friends.</p><p>Then, one day, she told me she was getting married.</p><p>I had seen the signs. The late-night phone calls, the mysterious texts, the way she smiled whenever she mentioned him. But when the words finally came, I couldn’t breathe. She was marrying someone else. My heart, which had long been dormant, suddenly felt like it was being ripped out of my chest. I didn’t know how to react. I wanted to scream, to cry, to tell her everything I had kept hidden for so long, but I didn’t.</p><p>Instead, I smiled and congratulated her, my voice shaking despite my best efforts to sound happy. It was a moment I would never forget—the moment I knew that everything had changed, that something inside me had died. But I couldn’t let her know. Not then, not like that. So I nodded and told her how thrilled I was for her, all while feeling a knot form in my stomach that I couldn’t untangle.</p><p>The wedding came and went. I was there, of course, sitting in the back row, trying to keep a brave face on while my heart shattered into a million pieces. I watched as she walked down the aisle, radiant and full of love, and I realized that I had lost her. Not in the way that you lose a person through distance or time, but in the sense that she would never look at me the same way again. I had missed my chance. And the worst part? I couldn’t even blame her. She had never known how I felt. I had hidden it from her for so long that I had allowed her to fall in love with someone else.</p><p>After the wedding, we drifted. It wasn’t intentional, but it happened. I couldn’t look at her without remembering everything I had lost. I couldn’t pretend to be just a friend anymore. So, we stopped talking as often, and the space between us grew wider with each passing day.</p><p>Months passed, and the silence between us became deafening. I thought about reaching out, but every time I did, I hesitated. What was I supposed to say? &ldquo;I love you, and I’ve loved you for years, but now it’s too late&rdquo;? What would that accomplish? Nothing. I couldn’t risk it.</p><p>One day, as I sat in my apartment, I started writing. I don’t know what prompted it, but I opened a blank document and began typing. The words flowed as if they had been waiting for years to be released. I wrote about the first time I met her, the countless hours we spent talking, the quiet moments of understanding, and the overwhelming feeling of love that I had buried deep inside. I poured my heart into that letter, each sentence more raw and vulnerable than the last.</p><p>I wrote about the day she told me she was getting married. How it felt like the ground had shifted beneath my feet, and I was no longer sure of who I was or where I belonged. I wrote about the emptiness I felt after the wedding, the aching void that seemed to follow me everywhere. I confessed that I had never been able to let her go, that no matter how hard I tried, she would always be the one person I would never forget.</p><p>And then, at the end of the letter, I wrote the words that I had never spoken aloud: &ldquo;I love you, Sarah. And I always will.&rdquo;</p><p>I stared at the screen for a long time, my heart pounding in my chest. The words were out there, raw and unfiltered. But I didn’t send it. I couldn’t. The reality of it hit me harder than anything before. What was the point? What good would it do now? She was married, and I had no place in her life anymore. It would only cause her pain, and I wasn’t willing to be the reason for that.</p><p>So I saved the letter, tucked it away in a folder, and never looked at it again. I never sent it because, deep down, I knew that it wasn’t just about telling her how I felt. It was about finally letting go, about accepting that some things are meant to remain unspoken. The letter became a symbol of everything I couldn’t change, of a love that would always remain unrequited.</p><p>Years went by, and life moved on. Sarah had children, and I had my own journey to follow. We saw each other occasionally, at parties or gatherings, but the distance between us was always palpable. There was a sadness in my eyes whenever I looked at her, a sorrow she probably never noticed. I never mentioned the letter. I never spoke of it again. And perhaps, in some ways, that was the hardest part: knowing that I had something to say, something important, but never being able to share it.</p><p>The letter I never sent became a piece of me, a quiet reminder of what could have been. It wasn’t a regret, per se, but a lingering feeling that I had missed an opportunity—a chance to say something that might have changed everything. Or maybe it wouldn’t have. Maybe sending it would have only made things worse. I’ll never know.</p><p>But I do know one thing: I’ll never forget Sarah. And though the letter remains unsent, it will always be a part of me, a testament to a love that never had the chance to bloom.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/love-and-heartbreak/>Love and Heartbreak</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-last-letter-love-loss-and-healing/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Last Letter: Love, Loss, and Healing</span>
