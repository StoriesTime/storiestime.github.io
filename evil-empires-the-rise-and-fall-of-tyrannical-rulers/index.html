His insatiable desire for wealth, land, and resources drove him to form an empire, which he ruled with an iron fist. Zarathustra was not alone in his pursuit of power; others rose and fell, vying for control over the vast and fertile land.</p><p>The first Evil Empire came to be through a violent and treacherous prison break. Zarathustra, alongside a handful of like-minded individuals, managed to escape their captivity in the dreaded Krazoran Fortress. They were fugitives who had nothing to lose and everything to gain by overthrowing the current dynasty. They managed to convert captured soldiers to their cause and quickly found themselves leading an army.</p><p>Their first military victory came against the peacefully ruling and unsuspecting Ardan family dynasty. The once-thriving and prosperous Ardan kingdom was swiftly and brutally conquered. The Ardan ruler and his kin met gruesome ends at the hands of Zarathustra&rsquo;s forces. The newly-formed Evil Empire became known far and wide, and towns and cities beyond the borders of Xydia trembled in fear at the name Zarathustra.</p><p>The rise of this Evil Empire led to the expansion of power, wealth, and control. The Empire survived and grew through insidious plots, deceit, treachery, and sheer force. Nevertheless, the downfall began through a marriage between two noble houses.</p><p>Gothmog, son of a powerful nobleman, married the daughter of a wealthy and influential merchant family to establish a powerful alliance against Zarathustra&rsquo;s Empire. With their combined resources, they built a formidable defense against the Evil Empire&rsquo;s continuous attempts to invade and conquer their lands.</p><p>The Empire&rsquo;s downfall began with arguments amongst the governing classes. As tensions grew and divisions widened, a radical and ambitious general named Thalion emerged. Thalion was a cunning and ruthless tactician who sought to overthrow Zarathustra and seize power for himself. He managed to gain the support of a section of the Empire&rsquo;s military forces.</p><p>Thalion led this faction, now the second Evil Empire, into fierce battles against the united forces of Gothmog and his newly-wedded ally. The battles were brutal and devastating, the kind of which the land of Xydia had never witnessed.</p><p>These internal battles caused chaos and confusion within the original Evil Empire. Many people began to lose faith in Zarathustra&rsquo;s rule, and divisions started to form throughout the Empire&rsquo;s ranks. Some factions defected to Thalion&rsquo;s new Empire, while others retreated to remote strongholds to wage a guerrilla war.</p><p>Ultimately, the downfall of the original Evil Empire was caused by its own rulers&rsquo; inability to unify their people. Thalion&rsquo;s faction managed to overthrow Zarathustra, and the original Empire crumbled before their very eyes. In the wake of this devastating conflict, the second Evil Empire emerged as the new and dominant power in the land.</p><p>But even this new Empire could not maintain its stranglehold on the land. Eventually, outside forces that had been wary of the internal conflict would not risk further destabilization. They intervened to prevent either Empire from consolidating undivided power over the land.</p><p>The outsiders forged alliances with the remaining factions, uniting them and allowing them to collectively transform into a new united force. With this newfound strength, a powerful and largely democratic system emerged from the ashes of the previous Empires.</p><p>In time, these united regions became the Magna Union - a chorus of voices that chose, with overwhelming consensus, to maintain peace and prosperity. The people learned that power can&rsquo;t be monopolized by one ruler or a small group of dictators. It must be shared and balanced to keep the coexistence and safety of all.</p><p>However, as history has shown time and again, even grand and wise systems can be threatened by those who dare to challenge the status quo. As we observe these events, we must remember that the evil we see is merely the consequence of our choices and actions, and that the rise and fall of an empire is the tale of humanity&rsquo;s constant push and pull between order and chaos.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/villains-and-antagonists/>Villains and Antagonists</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/evil-characters-that-define-great-short-stories/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Evil Characters That Define Great Short Stories</span>
