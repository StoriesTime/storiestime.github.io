His drink was simple; a single glass of water, untouched, on the sticky, ringed barstool beside him. The man, James, was a silent agent known as much for his discretion as for his deadly accuracy. His face was as enigmatic as the.questions he answered with his piercing blue eyes: a constant, silent nod.</p><p>The air in the room was thick with tension, as it always was in places of such illicit dealings. Conversations were in hushed tones, glances exchanged subtly as much as information. In a booth, two men huddled; one, a stout, sweat-drenched man known as Mr. Grey, and the other, an unassuming, thin man with sharp features, known only as the Client.</p><p>&ldquo;Gentlemen, I believe you are eager to conclude this particular endeavor,&rdquo; started the Client, his eyes darting around the room, &ldquo;And I assure you we have done our part.&rdquo;</p><p>Mr. Grey, gripping a sweat-dampened suit jacket, leaned in, &ldquo;Your agent has proven nothing short of exceptional,&rdquo; he said, his voice low and deadly, &ldquo;And as for the target? I understand he proves quite a challenge.&rdquo;</p><p>The Client smiled faintly. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t worry, Mr. Grey. The task is nearing its completion. Patterson has managed to infiltrate the circle of the target&rsquo;s closest allies. Within a week, we&rsquo;ll have what we came for - and your debt will be repaid in full.&rdquo;</p><p>A flicker of relief crossed the stout man&rsquo;s features before vanishing just as quickly. He nodded, unbending a little from his crouched position, &ldquo;Pleased to hear that.&rdquo;</p><p>At this, the Client&rsquo;s smile broadened, a bacchant echo of gold in his eyes, &ldquo;Splendid. Now, where was we? Ah, that&rsquo;s right. Patterson, my dear friend.&rdquo;</p><p>Just then, there was a rustle at the entrance of the bar. The proprietor shot a glance, straightened in his chair, and saw a figure moving with calculated purpose. Eyes lowering, he slid from behind his bar and moved stealthily towards James.</p><p>&ldquo;Patterson, my friend,&rdquo; the Client continued, not noticing these minor disruptions, &ldquo;He has done an exceptional job of ingratiating himself with the inner circle of the target. The files detailing their operations will be yours in due course - and the information on the &lsquo;Silent Agent&rsquo; will be ours.&rdquo;</p><p>The Client smugly toasted, his glass heavy with what looked to be a syrupy drink, to Mr. Grey.</p><p>The Client&rsquo;s smug smile turned into a bead of worry as the proprietor approached James. A gentle touch at his elbow reverberated through the sudden quiet of the air.</p><p>James stood so quickly that the chair overturned. He moved with the grace of a panther, a chill in his eyes as he turned his head to regard the proprietor, seemingly unflappable to the surprise that he bore.</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. James, there seems to be a misunderstanding, an additional demand from our side,&rdquo; the proprietor said softly, his voice betraying the gravity of the situation. &ldquo;A new condition.&rdquo;</p><p>James raised an eyebrow, turning his gaze fully upon the proprietor, &ldquo;Explain.&rdquo;</p><p>His voice was calm, cold - fittingly, uncannily calm - for the swift clip of his knives. They were poised between his fingers, catching strands of light amid the dim, flickering shadows. He held them in a grip honed from years of precision work. The silence of the bar seemed to momentarily coil around them, considering the outcome of these unexpected words.</p><p>The proprietor&rsquo;s eyes flickered, betraying a shiver of unease. &ldquo;You will collect two crates,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Your task is completed. One crate, as previously arranged, contains crucial files. The second&mldr; contains something of interest to an acquaintance of mine; a valuable particle, a secret of great worth.&rdquo;</p><p>There was the faintest of pauses, a moment of calculation in the triangular dance at the bar.</p><p>James tilted his head. His eyes seemed to gleam like the finest ice, mirroring the precision of his knives. He took a step forward, and in a sudden, swift movement, drew the knives to his sides. He dipped them into the two glasses of the Client and the proprietor, the sounds of detailed, expert work echoing through the silent room.</p><p>He inclined his head ever so slightly. &ldquo;Acceptable.&rdquo; His voice was calm, clear, and deadly. And then, without a second glance, he left the confines of the bar. A hushed, understanding spread in his wake, a chilled, deadly silence.</p><p>*A week later, the target&rsquo;s closest allies lay exposed, their files air-dropped into the hands of the proper authorities in an impeccable transfer of information. The shadowy figure of the Silent Agent had completed his task, exact and absolute, unbeknownst to the denizens of the underworld. *</p><p>The Client and Mr. Grey looked over their drink, startled as they realized the enormity of their misstep. There had been a silent agent. There would be no data to investigate the shadowy player. No one would know who had infiltrated their ranks.</p><p>For the Silent Agent was as mysterious as his name implied, leaving them to wonder sinisterly what they had actually contracted - and who in fact, had betrayed them. In the end, it would be remembered, the silent agent&rsquo;s presence implied, merely by the chilling files on their hands and the simple glass left on the stool beside him.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/espionage-and-spies/>Espionage and Spies</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-silent-agent-secrets-in-the-night/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Silent Agent: Secrets in the Night</span>
