It had been stolen in a robbery from her home just days before, and now she had wandered into Antique Haven, the city&rsquo;s largest and most diverse antiquarian shop.</p><p>The murky darkness of the store was pierced by streaks of light reflected from the multitude of vintage trinkets and collectibles meticulously arranged in dusty cases, and collections of fine china and meets of all kinds took up most of the available floor space.</p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; Iona said with a classic antiquated charm, approaching the desk of the store owner who was engrossed in some paperwork, &ldquo;I would like to know if you have a spare antique pocket watch.&rdquo;</p><p>The shop owner, who was known for his warm smile and impeccable taste, glanced up and examined Iona&rsquo;s face, then smiled and gestured towards a different aisle. He gestured to her to follow him. As they strode down the dim warehouse aisle, he explained, &ldquo;I have a collection of old pocket watches that I use to trade for different kinds of artifacts, but there hasn&rsquo;t been one like the one you&rsquo;re looking for in quite a while.&rdquo;</p><p>He opened a door to a hidden gem room, full of chandeliers and glowing trinkets, treasures, and keepsakes. In the center of the room was a circular stand showcasing vintage pocket watches.</p><p>&ldquo;I have a few different kinds. Here, this one is a lovely Garnetwood 19th-century silver pocket watch from Victorian England. Or perhaps this one, a Timekeeper&rsquo;s Paragon authenticating pocket watch from the 18th century, worth a good fortune.&rdquo;</p><p>Iona lost interest in them all. They were just echoes of what was once a paramount item in her life. Suddenly, she noticed the corner of the room. Buried amongst the ancient coins and relics, there it was – a pocket watch identical to her grandmother&rsquo;s, it even held the same paw-like hands and the sun-shaped face. She couldn&rsquo;t believe her eyes.</p><p>The owner must have noticed her gaze, &ldquo;Ah, yes, this one, the Harmony Timekeeper. That pocket watch has magical properties. It only surfaces once every 150 years, and the last known owner&rsquo;s lineage ended with the passing of her grandmother.&rdquo;</p><p>She made her choice immediately and asked if it was for sale. With a humble smile, the owner agreed, and soon enough, she was turning the Harmony Timekeeper over excitedly in her hands, noticing how its golden tones echoed the warm afternoons she spent listening to her grandmother&rsquo;s stories.</p><p>As she left Antique Haven, Iona could feel her steps lag as she didn&rsquo;t want to lose herself to the overwhelming whirlwind of remembrances. The Harmony Timekeeper, she knew, would act as a bridge between her and her grandmother. It was time to embrace her story, to seek sweet memories and grow old gracefully.</p><p>Now, Iona spends her afternoons in her grandmother&rsquo;s garden, weeds in hand, reminiscing about the good old days and listening to the echoes of time that the Harmony Timekeeper soothes for her. For every echo brings a glimpse into the life of her vibrant gran, – and in the quiet corners of heaven, she hopes, her gram right now is looking down with that same alluring smile, proud to have chosen wisely.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/aging-and-wisdom/>Aging and Wisdom</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/echoes-of-time-short-stories-on-aging-with-grace-and-wisdom/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Echoes of Time: Short Stories on Aging with Grace and Wisdom</span>
