From social activists championing for equality and justice to educators revolutionizing the way we learn, the book painted a vivid portrait of leadership in its most inspiring form.</p><p>The common thread that connected all these stories was the idea that true leadership was not about wielding power or authority but about empowering others, fostering collaboration, and driving positive change.
