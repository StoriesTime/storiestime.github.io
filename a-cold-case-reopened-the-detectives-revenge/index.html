At this hour, the patrol cars vanished into the fog, and the city belonged to the night. Detective Justine Mercer stood on the threshold of the precinct, holding in her gloved hands a battered file stamped with the word “Closed.” Years ago, someone had put a red line through that word and scribbled the date. The ink had faded, but not the memory.</p><p>She walked inside, boots echoing on scratched linoleum. Her desk lamp still burned in the corner. She dropped the file on her desk, its contents fanning out: photographs curled at the corners, typed interviews gone yellow at the edges, a single chess piece—the black knight—taped to an evidence bag.</p><p>Ashford’s infamous cold case, the Laskin Murder, had been her first real investigation. She’d failed to solve it, failed to bring closure to the Laskin family, and the case had gathered dust along with her hope. Until tonight, when her captain had whispered two words that changed everything: <em>new evidence</em>.</p><p>Justine leafed through the photos again. Emiline Laskin, twenty-six, drowned in her own bathtub, wrists slashed, but no water in her lungs. Staged suicide, everyone agreed. The lead suspect, Anton Varley, skipped town. The evidence? Circumstantial, contradictory, and ultimately dismissed.</p><p>Now, after all these years, she was about to open wounds no one else wanted disturbed.</p><h2 id=chapter-two-ripples-under-ice>Chapter Two: Ripples Under Ice</h2><p>Rain battered the city, beading on the precinct’s windows. Justine’s breath made small clouds in the cold office. She replayed the tape—the one that hadn’t surfaced during the original investigation. The forensic audio tech had worked some magic. Crackling, then a woman’s voice:</p><p>“Anton, no, please—I just want to leave—”</p><p>A thud. Muffled shouting. The tape ended there. But it was Emiline’s voice, tired and broken. And with that, the knots in the case began to loosen.</p><p>She booted up her database, fingers flying over keys. Varley’s last known address: an abandoned rail-side motel, twinned with flaky paint and rusty swing sets. No trace of him since months after Emiline’s death.</p><p>She slid the tape into evidence, pulled on her jacket, and headed into the drizzle. Retracing steps she’d worn into her soul.</p><h2 id=chapter-three-the-forgotten-witness>Chapter Three: The Forgotten Witness</h2><p>The motel crouched under tree limbs, shivering in the downpour. Justine flashed her badge to the night manager, a stooped woman with nicotine fingers.</p><p>“Looking for Anton Varley,” Justine said.</p><p>The woman snorted, her smile an implied secret. “Left years ago, but his old friend, Tulio, works at the garage out back. Might have seen something.”</p><p>Tulio was hunched over the engine of a rust-pocked sedan, humming to himself. When Justine introduced herself, his mouth twitched, and a wary look flickered across his face.</p><p>“Anton? He’s history. Hell, most people say he’s dead.”</p><p>Justine pressed. “Did he mention why he left?”</p><p>Tulio wiped grit from his nails and shrugged. “Said someone was after him, not the cops. Said ‘she’ was everywhere. Real jumpy—started carrying this.” He mimed a small pistol, twitching his finger like a trigger.</p><p>She scribbled a note. “Was it Emiline?”</p><p>Tulio ducked his head. “Dunno. Sometimes, I’d see him staring at the chess board, mumbling about moves only he could make.”</p><p>Chess. Justine remembered the black knight. The last move in Emiline’s unfinished game.</p><h2 id=chapter-four-pieces-in-play>Chapter Four: Pieces in Play</h2><p>Back at her desk, Justine lined up what she knew. Varley, obsessed with chess, running from a shadow. Missing pieces—literal and metaphorical. The autopsy report had noted Emiline’s index finger was stained with ink. Not blood. No one checked what she was writing.</p><p>Reviewing the photos, Justine caught a detail she’d overlooked: behind Emiline’s bathtub, a water-stained crossword puzzle torn from a book. The puzzles. Emiline loved them. The Laskins had said as much. The crossword, still partially solved, bore several bizarre, ink-blotted answers.</p><p>She contacted Ashford’s best puzzle expert, Gus Collins, a retired teacher who thrived on cryptic clues and coffee. When he got to the precinct, Gus studied the crossword with a narrowed gaze.</p><p>“She wasn’t solving a crossword, detective. She was sending a message. Look—circled letters. They spell out: K-N-I-G-H-T. And here—the numbers one through eight. Like the squares on a chess board.”</p><p>A map. Or a warning.</p><h2 id=chapter-five-the-boxed-knight>Chapter Five: The Boxed Knight</h2><p>Chess boards littered Justine’s living room; each arrangement mapped to Emiline’s possible message. She retraced games, mapped the clues. The black knight, taped in evidence, had coordinates she’d missed: E5, burned into the felt.</p><p>She followed the trail to Ashford’s abandoned train roundhouse on Fifth, boarded-up and forgotten. She sliced through the fencing and ducked beneath old searchlights. Inside, the roundhouse stank of oil and rot, echoing with the scuttle of rats.</p><p>In the dead center, she found a rotted wooden chest—locked but crumbling. The knight fit a hidden slot in the lid, releasing the catch. Inside: Varley’s journal, a broken phone, and a cassette.</p><p>She played the cassette with trembling hands. Varley’s voice, ragged and panicked: “She knows. She always knows. Emiline’s not dead, not even close—she’s everywhere, she’s—” Static. Then a different voice. “You should have played fair, Anton. But you always cheat.”</p><p>Justine remembered that night in the morgue. The pathologist said Emiline’s death was unlike any other, almost theatrical. Someone wanted it staged.</p><h2 id=chapter-six-revenge-unleashed>Chapter Six: Revenge Unleashed</h2><p>The phone held a grainy video. Emiline, hair wet, bleeding from her wrists but smirking, addressing the camera:</p><p>“If you’re watching this, you know who did this to me. But tonight, the board resets. It’s your move, Anton.”</p><p>Justine scoured the journal. Amid rambling paranoia were names—people who’d testified, who’d tried to help Emiline. And in the margins, a symbol: the same black knight, sketched again and again.</p><p>The investigation pivoted. She trawled hospital records and found another woman—Mila Jensen—admitted to hospital with wounds uncannily like Emiline’s, months after Emiline’s death. Jensen had been Anton’s old flame.</p><p>In Mila’s statement, she claimed Anton tried to recreate the scene of Emiline’s death but failed. “He kept muttering about unfinished games.”</p><p>When Justine interviewed Mila, the truth spilled out: “He wanted revenge on everyone who doubted him. He tried to make me ‘confess’ like Emiline, but I ran. He thinks Emiline was the mastermind. He’s obsessed.”</p><p>Obsession, not guilt. The case had been a convoluted chess game, Anton sacrificing everyone to cover his tracks, haunted by the illusion that Emiline was still alive, pulling strings from beyond the grave.</p><h2 id=chapter-seven-checkmate>Chapter Seven: Checkmate</h2><p>Ashford closed in on Anton, now living under an alias in a shantytown upstate. SWAT surrounded his trailer, officers whispering over radios, black vests gleaming.</p><p>Justine entered first.</p><p>Anton sat at a crooked table, a chess set before him. He looked up, hollow-eyed. “It was always you, wasn’t it, detective?”</p><p>Justine ignored him, eyes on the board. The final move: black knight, E5—a perfect checkmate.</p><p>“You’re under arrest for the murder of Emiline Laskin, the attempted murder of Mila Jensen, and conspiracy to commit fraud.”</p><p>Anton smiled, a twisted, broken thing. “You never saw the board.”</p><p>He rose, hands trembling. For a second, she thought he might attack. Then he slumped, defeated. “It was all her. She made me do it.”</p><p>But Justine saw through him. Anton had orchestrated the events, using Emiline’s intellect as a smokescreen, projecting his paranoia onto her memory while hunting her spirit through his own madness.</p><h2 id=chapter-eight-unfreezing-the-past>Chapter Eight: Unfreezing the Past</h2><p>With Anton in custody, justifying his actions with the ramblings of a lost man, Justine stood over Emiline’s grave. The winter sun glinted off the headstone. She placed the black knight between frozen violets.</p><p>“I finished your game,” she whispered. “He’ll never hurt anyone again.”</p><p>As the city thawed and the precinct closed the case, Justine allowed herself a rare moment of pride. It hadn’t been about revenge. It was about seeing the game through—to its bitter, final end.</p><p>But as she walked away, the chill in the air felt a little less menacing, the ghosts of Ashford silent, if only for tonight.</p><hr><p><strong>END</strong></p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/crime-and-detective-stories/>Crime and Detective Stories</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=next href=https://stories.googlexy.com/a-cold-case-reopened-the-hunt-for-justice/><span class=title>Next »</span><br><span>A Cold Case Reopened: The Hunt for Justice</span></a></nav><nav class=paginav><ul style=list-style-type:none><li><small>See Also</small></li><li><ul style=list-style-type:none><li><small><a href=/murder-at-the-crossroads-a-detectives-race-against-time/>Murder at the Crossroads: A Detective's Race Against Time</a></small></li><li><small><a href=/the-enigmatic-detective-a-collection-of-intriguing-crime-stories/>The Enigmatic Detective: A Collection of Intriguing Crime Stories</a></small></li><li><small><a href=/murder-on-elm-street-a-detectives-race-against-time/>Murder on Elm Street: A Detective's Race Against Time</a></small></li><li><small><a href=/silent-shadows-crime-mysteries-uncovered/>Silent Shadows: Crime Mysteries Uncovered</a></small></li><li><small><a href=/whispers-of-deceit-the-case-of-the-missing-heiress/>Whispers of Deceit: The Case of the Missing Heiress</a></small></li></ul></li></ul></nav></footer></article></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2025 <a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/>All the stories are here!</a></span></footer><a href=#top aria-label="go to top" title="Go to Top (Alt + G)" class=top-link id=top-link accesskey=g><svg viewBox="0 0 12 6" fill="currentcolor"><path d="M12 6H0l6-6z"/></svg>
