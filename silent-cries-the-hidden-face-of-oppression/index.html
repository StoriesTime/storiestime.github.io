Take, for example, Maria, a young mother living on the streets. Her hands trembled each time she received a letter from the government, summoning her to meet with a representative. These encounters usually ended with a few lines scribbled on a strip of paper, dictating how much she could earn, where she could live, and how she could parent her three children. Papers like these were nearly impossible to restore or contest, making every effort at self-sufficiency and independanthood redundant. Few who sought assistance managed to keep their dignity intact.

Silent Cries: The Hidden Face of Oppression
In the heart of the city, a vibrant public square bustled with street performers, cafes, and market stalls. But what the tourists saw as a lively oasis was just a veil, masking a more sinister reality. Amidst the cheers and applause, the oppression of human rights and freedoms echoed silently through the buildings. These whispers were the silenced voices of ordinary people living on the periphery.
Take Maria, a young mother living on the streets. She received letters from the government summoning her to meet with a representative, only to be dictated how much she could earn, where she could live, and how she could parent her three children. These papers, nearly impossible to restore or contest, reduced every effort at self-sufficiency to nothing.
Years had passed since Elijah, a refugee from his country of birth, became a law enforcement officer. His profession as a dentist was now redundant, his partner struggling financially. The spat lingered on, the abundance of orders and mandates suffocating his dreams.
Meanwhile, the city's underbelly was hidden from view. Small, unassuming cafes, where refugees and asylum seekers huddled in secret, their tears and fears silently accumulating. Khaled, a young refugee from Syria, worked alone, his hands flying as he crafted exquisite pieces of art. Yet, his creations were sold under his former employer's name, a tiny fraction of the profit trickling down to him. Unaware of the negotiation process even their unwilling presence looked misplaced hence propag blind expensive.
