The villagers went about their business, farming, trading, and living in peaceful obscurity. But all that changed the moment the strange mark appeared on Eliza Hawthorne’s neck.</p><p>Eliza, a young woman of twenty-five, had lived her entire life in Northbrook, known for her bright smile and kind heart. She had no enemies, no reason to attract ill will. Yet, there it was—a blackened symbol, resembling an intricate knot of vines and thorns, burned into her skin, just beneath her right ear. The mark appeared without warning, a dark stain against her pale skin. It was the kind of thing you only heard of in stories or whispered superstitions, the mark of the witch.</p><p>At first, Eliza tried to ignore it. She told herself it was a rash, an odd allergic reaction to something she couldn’t remember touching. But the mark didn’t fade. It grew darker over the course of the following days, and its shape became clearer, more deliberate. She could feel its weight, like the eyes of unseen watchers upon her, always at the edge of her vision.</p><p>A week later, Eliza woke one morning to find her bedchamber filled with an oppressive silence. There was no chirping of birds outside, no wind rustling the trees. The air was still, too still. Her heart raced as she noticed the mark had changed. It was no longer just a stain. It had spread.</p><p>It now wrapped around her neck like a chain, its edges darker, jagged, as though it were alive. With a gasp, she stumbled to her mirror. Her reflection confirmed what her mind had already feared: she was no longer the woman she had been before. The mark had consumed her.</p><p>Eliza&rsquo;s pulse quickened. The villagers had spoken of witches and curses for years, but it was always distant, something from old tales. A man named Richard, a man known for his unshakable faith and devotion, approached her. He had always been kind, and their families had known each other for generations. But when he saw the mark, his face went pale.</p><p>&ldquo;You must go to the woods,&rdquo; Richard said, his voice tremulous. &ldquo;To the old witch’s hut. You’ve been chosen. There’s no other way.&rdquo;</p><p>The witch&rsquo;s hut was no longer a myth, not to Eliza. It was said to lie deep within the forests surrounding Northbrook, hidden from prying eyes. It had been abandoned for decades, the place where dark magic was practiced, where the boundary between this world and the next blurred.</p><p>Eliza&rsquo;s thoughts whirled in her head. She couldn’t possibly go there. Not alone, not with what had happened to her. But as the days wore on and the mark on her neck began to throb painfully, she realized she had no choice. The witch’s mark was no longer something she could ignore. It was a curse, a force she could not escape.</p><p>The next morning, armed with nothing but her resolve, Eliza set out toward the forest. Richard, though clearly afraid, followed her for a while before he finally stopped at the edge of the woods.</p><p>“You must go alone,” he said, his voice full of regret. “The witch won’t reveal herself if anyone else is present. I cannot go with you.”</p><p>Eliza turned to look at him, unsure whether to be grateful or fearful of his departure. But there was no time to waste. She entered the forest, the thick canopy above casting the world in shadow. The silence was unnerving, broken only by the crunch of her boots on the undergrowth.</p><p>Hours passed, and Eliza grew disoriented. The forest seemed to stretch on endlessly, the trees growing thicker, more menacing as the sky above darkened. Every rustling leaf, every snapped twig, made her jump. It was as though the forest itself was alive, watching her every step.</p><p>Finally, just as the last light of day faded, Eliza saw it: the witch&rsquo;s hut. It stood like a monument to forgotten power, twisted vines clinging to its weathered frame. The air around it hummed with an unnatural energy, a quiet whisper that seemed to call to her.</p><p>With trembling hands, Eliza approached the door and knocked.</p><p>The door creaked open, revealing the figure of a woman, her features sharp and age-old, her hair a wild tangle of gray. Her eyes were black as night, glistening like obsidian, yet filled with an unsettling warmth.</p><p>&ldquo;You have come,&rdquo; the woman said in a voice that sent shivers down Eliza&rsquo;s spine. &ldquo;I have been waiting.&rdquo;</p><p>Eliza stepped into the dim light of the hut, feeling the warmth of the fire crackling in the hearth. The woman did not move, but Eliza felt as though every part of her body was being examined, weighed, judged.</p><p>“Why did this happen to me?” Eliza asked, her voice cracking with fear.</p><p>The woman’s lips curled into a slow smile. “You bear the witch’s mark because you were chosen, child. Chosen by a power older than time itself. The mark is not a curse, but a test. The test of the witch.”</p><p>Eliza’s mind spun with questions. “A test? For what?”</p><p>“For strength,” the woman replied. “For courage. For the ability to wield what lies within you. The mark will only fade when you prove yourself worthy.”</p><p>“What do I have to do?” Eliza’s voice was barely above a whisper, her throat dry.</p><p>“You must confront the darkness within the forest. You must enter the realm of the spirits and face your deepest fears. Only then will you be able to break the curse and rid yourself of the mark.”</p><p>Eliza’s heart hammered in her chest. The woman’s words made no sense. How could she face something like that? How could she possibly survive?</p><p>“You have no choice, child,” the woman continued. “You are bound to the mark. And only by confronting the darkness will you be free.”</p><p>With a final glance at the woman, Eliza stepped back into the night. The cold air bit at her skin, but there was no turning back now. The mark burned on her neck, its presence stronger than ever. She could feel the pull of something deep within the forest, something ancient and powerful. It called to her, beckoning her forward.</p><p>Eliza ventured deeper into the forest, each step heavier than the last. The trees closed in around her, their twisted branches reaching for her like claws. The whispering wind seemed to carry voices, low and distant, speaking in a language she could not understand.</p><p>Suddenly, the ground beneath her feet gave way, and Eliza tumbled into darkness. She landed hard, her body aching from the fall. The air was thick with the scent of earth and decay. She stood, brushing dirt from her clothes, and looked around.</p><p>The world around her was no longer the forest she had known. This place was strange—twisted, unreal. Shadows moved in the corner of her vision, and the silence was deafening. She could feel the weight of the mark on her neck, pulsing with energy.</p><p>A figure emerged from the shadows, tall and cloaked in darkness. It was a man, his face hidden beneath a hood. But there was something wrong with him—his movements were jerky, unnatural. He spoke in a low, rasping voice.</p><p>“Who dares enter the realm of the spirits?” he asked.</p><p>Eliza took a step forward, her heart pounding in her chest. “I seek to rid myself of the witch’s mark.”</p><p>The figure laughed, a sound that echoed through the darkened realm. “The mark can never be erased, child. It is a part of you. To rid yourself of it, you must first rid yourself of your own darkness.”</p><p>Eliza’s breath caught in her throat. “What do you mean?”</p><p>The figure stepped closer, his face now visible. His eyes were hollow, black pits. “The witch’s mark is not just a curse, but a mirror. It shows you the darkness within yourself—the fear, the doubt, the guilt that you carry. You cannot escape it, because it is a part of you.”</p><p>Eliza felt the weight of his words settling over her like a storm cloud. The mark on her neck burned hotter, and she fell to her knees, clutching at it in agony.</p><p>“You must face it,” the figure said, his voice cold and final. “Only then will you be free.”</p><p>With that, the figure disappeared into the shadows, leaving Eliza alone in the dark.</p><p>She closed her eyes, her heart racing. The whispering wind began again, louder now, urging her to move forward. She had no choice. She had to confront her own darkness, whatever that meant.</p><p>Step by step, Eliza walked deeper into the realm of the spirits. She could feel the mark on her neck throbbing, pulsing with a power that she didn’t understand. Every shadow seemed to close in on her, every step seemed to pull her deeper into the unknown.</p><p>And then, she saw it—the figure of a woman, standing in the distance. She was familiar, her face a twisted version of Eliza’s own. The woman’s eyes were filled with sorrow, regret.</p><p>“Eliza,” the woman said, her voice a haunting echo. “You cannot escape yourself.”</p><p>The ground beneath Eliza’s feet seemed to tremble, and she realized that the woman was not just a reflection. She was a part of Eliza—her fear, her doubts, her darkest thoughts made flesh.</p><p>“You are me,” Eliza whispered.</p><p>The woman smiled, a sad, twisted smile. “And you are me. We are one.”</p><p>The mark burned hotter, and Eliza fell to her knees, tears streaming down her face. She had to face herself—her darkest fears, her greatest regrets. Only then would she be free.</p><p>The mark on her neck flared with a final burst of energy, and Eliza felt something shift deep inside her. The darkness began to fade, and the weight of the curse lifted. She had faced herself and survived.</p><p>When she returned to the village, the mark was gone. But she was forever changed, carrying with her the memory of the witch’s mark and the darkness she had faced within herself.</p><p>And as for the witch, the ancient power in the forest? It waited for the next soul to enter its grasp, for there was always another witch’s mark, always another test.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/supernatural-and-paranormal/>Supernatural and Paranormal</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-witchs-forbidden-magic/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Witch's Forbidden Magic</span>
