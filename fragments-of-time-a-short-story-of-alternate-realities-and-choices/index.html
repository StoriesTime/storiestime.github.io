Grace woke up to the soft hum of her alarm clock, the light filtering through the blinds, casting thin shadows on the walls. She stretched her arms, blinking in the early morning light as she thought about the tasks that lay ahead. There was always a sense of dread attached to the mundane—meetings, emails, and the constant pressure to stay ahead. But today, something felt different. It was a strange sensation, an unease that she couldn&rsquo;t quite place.</p><p>&ldquo;Just another Tuesday,&rdquo; she whispered to herself, trying to shake the feeling.</p><p>Grace walked into the kitchen, made her coffee, and then, as she did every morning, checked her phone. A string of notifications. News updates, messages from colleagues, and one text from her best friend, Sarah: &ldquo;Lunch today? It’s been too long!&rdquo; Grace smiled at the message, typing out a quick response. It felt good to know she had some connection to the outside world beyond her work.</p><p>She glanced at the time. There were only a few minutes before she needed to leave. As she prepared to step out, something caught her eye—a glimmer in the corner of the room. It was the mirror on the wall, an antique that had been in her family for generations. But today, it seemed different. It wasn’t that it looked out of place, but rather that it felt… alive. The reflection stared back at her, but in a way that didn’t seem quite right.</p><p>Grace shook her head, attributing the odd feeling to the early hour and her lack of sleep. &ldquo;Just tired,&rdquo; she muttered, grabbing her bag and heading out the door.</p><hr><p>As the day unfolded, the feeling of unease stayed with her, growing stronger, like a shadow following her every step. At work, she found herself distracted. She couldn’t concentrate on the emails in front of her. The hum of the office felt distant, and the voices of her colleagues sounded like an echo from far away.</p><p>The reflection in the mirror kept creeping into her mind. She had never thought much of it before, but now, something about it gnawed at her. It was just a mirror, wasn’t it? She couldn’t shake the image of it—a faint shimmer in the glass, like a doorway, like something was waiting just beyond the surface. Was she losing her mind?</p><p>As Grace stared out the window of her office, lost in thought, her phone buzzed. Another text from Sarah: “Lunch at noon? You still in?”</p><p>Grace blinked, looking at the time. It was 12:30 p.m. She had completely lost track of time. “Sure,” she typed back. She grabbed her bag and headed out, not noticing the clock as it ticked in the corner of her office, its hands moving in a pattern that didn’t quite match the world around her.</p><hr><p>Lunch with Sarah was meant to be a break, a chance to reset, but Grace couldn’t focus. Sarah was talking about her new project, but Grace couldn’t keep her mind on the conversation. Instead, she kept thinking about that strange feeling from the morning—the reflection in the mirror, the disjointed moments in the office, and the gnawing sense that something was off.</p><p>“Grace, you’re quiet today. Everything alright?” Sarah’s voice pulled her from her thoughts.</p><p>“Huh? Oh, yeah. Just… a lot on my mind,” Grace replied, forcing a smile.</p><p>Sarah raised an eyebrow. “You’ve been distant lately. More than usual.”</p><p>“I know. I just feel… out of sync. Like I’m not in the right place. Or maybe I’m in the wrong time.”</p><p>“Right time? Wrong time?” Sarah laughed, but Grace didn’t find it funny.</p><p>Sarah leaned forward, looking at her with concern. “Grace, you’re worrying me. Maybe you should take a day off.”</p><p>Grace shook her head. “I can’t. I’m fine. Really.”</p><p>But she wasn’t fine. In fact, she had never felt more lost in her own life. It was as though she was walking through a haze, a world that didn’t quite align with her. Nothing felt real. Not the food she was eating, not the conversation she was having, and certainly not the reflection in the glass. The mirror, the one that had seemed to shimmer this morning, now felt like a portal. A doorway to something more.</p><p>“I’ll be fine,” Grace said, standing up abruptly. “I have to go.”</p><p>Before Sarah could protest, Grace had already left the restaurant, her mind racing with the strange feeling that had overtaken her. Something was happening. She could feel it in every fiber of her being. It wasn’t just a bad day or a passing thought. It was as though the world was shifting around her, and she was the only one who noticed.</p><hr><p>That evening, after a long and unsettling day, Grace arrived back home. She dropped her bag by the door and went straight to the living room. The mirror. She couldn’t stop thinking about it.</p><p>She stood before it, her reflection staring back at her, and this time, it didn’t feel like her own. The person in the glass was her, but there was something different. The eyes were too distant, the expression too vacant. For a moment, the reflection seemed to flicker, like an image on a broken screen. Grace’s breath caught in her throat as she reached out, her fingers brushing against the surface.</p><p>Suddenly, everything shifted.</p><p>The world around her began to blur, like she was falling through a tunnel. Colors twisted, sounds warped, and her body felt weightless. She closed her eyes, gripped by an overwhelming sense of vertigo. Then, in an instant, everything stopped.</p><p>When Grace opened her eyes, she was no longer in her apartment. The walls were different. The furniture, the lighting, the feel of the air—everything was unfamiliar. She stumbled back, trying to make sense of what had just happened. Was this a dream? A hallucination?</p><p>But no, it was real. She could feel the cold wood of the floor beneath her feet, the texture of the fabric on the couch. She was in a different place, a different reality. The mirror had transported her, somehow. She wasn’t sure how, or why, but she had crossed into an alternate version of her world.</p><p>There was no time to wonder about the details, though. Her phone buzzed in her pocket, pulling her back to the present. She pulled it out and saw a message from Sarah: “Grace, where are you? I’m at the restaurant. Did something happen?”</p><p>Grace’s hands trembled as she typed, “I don’t know what’s going on. I’m somewhere else. Help.”</p><p>Before she could send the message, the phone flickered, and the screen went black. Her heart pounded in her chest. What was happening? Was she stuck here? Would she ever get back?</p><p>She looked around the room, noticing a door at the far end. Maybe there was someone who could help, someone who could explain this strange place. She moved toward it, but as her hand grasped the handle, she hesitated. What if this reality was just as fractured as the one she had left behind?</p><p>But there was no choice. She turned the handle and stepped through.</p><hr><p>The room she entered was dimly lit, but she could make out the shapes of a man and a woman sitting at a table. The man’s face was familiar, but not quite right. It was a version of someone Grace knew, but he looked older, more worn, as though the years had been harsher on him here. The woman beside him had a familiar air about her too, but her features were clouded by the uncertainty of this alternate reality.</p><p>“Grace,” the man said, his voice low, but full of recognition. “You made it.”</p><p>&ldquo;Made it?&rdquo; Grace whispered, her voice trembling. “What’s going on? Where am I?”</p><p>“Relax,” the woman said. “You’re safe here. You’ve crossed through. We’ve been waiting for you.”</p><p>“Waiting for me?” Grace felt a chill run through her.</p><p>“Yes,” the man replied. “You’ve crossed over from your reality to ours. But you’re not just a traveler. You’re the key.”</p><p>“The key?” Grace’s mind spun. “The key to what?”</p><p>“To the fractures. The broken pieces of time,” the woman explained. “There are many realities, Grace. Each one is a different version of what could have been, based on choices made. The mirror is a bridge. You’ve come at a critical moment, when the balance of the worlds is shifting.”</p><p>The weight of the words settled over her like a dark cloud. “I don’t understand.”</p><p>“Not yet,” the man said. “But you will. You have to. The choices you make here, in this reality, will ripple across the others. Time is fractured, and only you can fix it.”</p><hr><p>Grace stood there, caught between confusion and fear, unsure of what to believe or where to go. The mirror had opened a door, but she wasn’t sure if she wanted to step through it.</p><p>One choice.</p><p>One moment.</p><p>Would she stay in this world, or return to her own? What was waiting for her in the world she knew? And more importantly, could she fix the fractures that seemed to haunt every reality?</p><p>As she looked into the eyes of the man and the woman, she realized something. Every choice, every decision, every moment was a thread in the tapestry of existence. And with each choice, the timeline of her life—of all lives—was altered, shaped, and ultimately, broken.</p><p>But Grace wasn’t just a passenger in this journey. She was the architect. And with that realization came the weight of responsibility.</p><p>The mirror was more than a reflection. It was the key to her future.</p><p>And the future of all realities.</p><p><strong>End.</strong></p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/time-travel-and-alternate-realities/>Time Travel and Alternate Realities</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/fragments-of-the-future-time-travel-and-parallel-worlds/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Fragments of the Future: Time Travel and Parallel Worlds</span>
