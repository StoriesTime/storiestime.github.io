Books, papers, and calculuses were strewn about, as if a tempest had crashed through and left chaos in its wake. At the center of the mess sat a man, his shaggy hair and unkempt beard hiding an intense gaze. He was engrossed in an equation, muttering to himself and scribbling furiously on a chalkboard.</p><p>I was introduced to him as the physicist Professor Albert Einstein. His eyes flickered to me for a moment before he said, &ldquo;Ah, you&rsquo;re just in time. I believe this young man has solved a problem that&rsquo;s been gnawing at my mind for days.&rdquo;</p><p>It was a bizarre introduction to the enigmatic genius, but I was intrigued. What was the problem Einstein couldn&rsquo;t solve, and how could I potentially help?</p><p>The answer was frustratingly elusive; the more I searched for it, the more elusive it became. But I couldn&rsquo;t abandon the quest. Einstein was like a gmina, tugging me deeper into the tangled obscurity of his mind.</p><p>One day, I found myself in the room I always found myself in: Einstein&rsquo;s cluttered office.</p><p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s it going?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just&mldr;&rdquo; I hesitated. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just it feels as though I&rsquo;m chasing a ghost. An idea. But I can&rsquo;t tell if it&rsquo;s leading me anywhere or if I&rsquo;m just lost in the wilderness.&rdquo;</p><p>Einstein chuckled, a warm, contagious sound in the room. &ldquo;You know what I say? Don&rsquo;t worry about the goal; worry about the steps. What&rsquo;s the next piece of the puzzle you plan on putting in place?&rdquo;</p><p>I couldn&rsquo;t help but feel that his empathetic question was reminiscent of his famous quote, &ldquo;The only source of knowledge is experience.&rdquo; In my attempts to solve the riddles of Einstein&rsquo;s mind, I was accumulating experiences and learning that sometimes, the journey was more important than the destination&ndash;just like with the troubled young man who had taken time out from his studies to visit the genius in his cluttered home.</p><p>There was a knock at the door.</p><p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; called out Einstein, whose glance at the door&rsquo;s intrusion revealed surprise before it flickered to curiosity, and eventually settled on amusement.</p><p>In walked an attractive young lady. She was stern and direct, an intensity to her gaze that seemed at odds with the room&rsquo;s laid-back, chaotic charm.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Dr. Elsa Einstein,&rdquo; she said with a firm handshake. &ldquo;My husband welcomes you to our home.&rdquo;</p><p>Einstein&rsquo;s wife. It hadn&rsquo;t occurred to me that there might be a personal side to the genius, that he might one day choose to retire for the evening and read a book, or play a game of chess with his spouse.</p><p>Weirdly, this newfound knowledge of Einstein&rsquo;s personal life pushed me even further into his intellectual wealth. While it was perhaps a more humanizing insight into the man behind the equations, the moniker &ldquo;The Enigma,&rdquo; seemed to crystallize within the room.</p><p>The morning was cold, a man&rsquo;s breath smoking as he jogged on the barren brown path. He wore a ragged jacket and pants, a pair of worn boots, but no gloves, with dirt and sweat marring his lean features.</p><p>I was half-surprised that Einstein lived in such a simple manner, but the repeated visits to his home early in the morning had enlightened me like nothing else. His daily routine was nothing short of a spectacle. However, I knew that the simple, old life he always spoke of and his present life had a few things in common: hard work, commitment, and the pursuit of knowledge.</p><p>The last time I had come by for tea, Einstein complained about a headache. &ldquo;The work,&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t stop.&rdquo;</p><p>But Einstein&rsquo;s new analysis theory was the talk of many in Switzerland and beyond. No one could deny that it might be his most revolutionary work.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re trying to decipher it, Albert,&rdquo; Elsa offered, tracing a finger along the paper with nearly religious devotion.</p><p>Einstein rambled on, the cacophony of physics, mathematics, and wisdom like a divine opera score.</p><p>&ldquo;Let us remember how people used to laugh at Gutenberg! He said he could make a gadget that could print a versatile range of typefaces based on a network of individual moveable type. They laughed, but Gutenberg changed the world, just as we hope to do.&rdquo;</p><p>His eyes lit up with a blend of immediacy and boldness. The eternity of the universe seemed to enter the room as he painted an extensive landscape of the labyrinthine.</p><p>I couldn&rsquo;t help but think of the quote that had once struck me hard and fast when I saw the genius&rsquo;s name on a book cover: &ldquo;The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing.&rdquo;</p><p>In the end, the lamplight would flicker off, and Einstein would only retire when the darkness threatened his work.</p><p>The day after the theories were supposed to be finished, I looked down at the manuscript. It was like an ocean of bewilderment.</p><p>&ldquo;This is too much, Albert,&rdquo; Elsa conceded.</p><p>But Einstein had only one question left.</p><p>&ldquo;The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science,&rdquo; he said, hands scratched and bleeding from the worn-out glassboards. &ldquo;But it is the source of all our sadness as well.&rdquo;</p><p>I watched him absorbed in working out the mystery, pulling his pipe to his mouth.</p><p>Then Einstein turned and uttered the last line in the book, the last try at cracking the Enigma.</p><p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t we accept tragedy as part of life?&rdquo;</p><p>And with that, the room darkened. The enigmatic genius had done what he had to.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/famous-personalities/>Famous Personalities</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-enigmatic-genius-a-glimpse-into-albert-einsteins-world/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Enigmatic Genius: A Glimpse into Albert Einstein's World</span>
