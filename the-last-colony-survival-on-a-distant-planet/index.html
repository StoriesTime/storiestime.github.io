In the cockpit, Captain Elias Marten gripped the controls with white-knuckled determination, his eyes scanning the readouts that painted a grim picture. The colony on Khyros-7, a distant exoplanet in the Arcturus system, had not been heard from in weeks. A resounding silence had followed their last transmission, which had cut off abruptly.</p><p>With the engines roaring and the shuttle descending through layers of turbulent clouds, Elias felt the weight of the responsibility settle on his shoulders. He had been assigned to lead the rescue mission with a small crew. The mission: find out what had happened to the colony and, if possible, bring back survivors.</p><p>But as the shuttle cut through the final layers of clouds, a sight met his eyes that made his heart skip a beat—beyond the storm, the land below was scorched, darkened, and devoid of life. The faint glow of distant buildings was the only sign of human existence, but they seemed abandoned, desolate.</p><p>“Landing gear down,” Elias ordered, his voice calm but tense, knowing the worst was still to come. He could feel the immense gravitational pull of the planet, forcing him to concentrate more than ever.</p><p>&ldquo;Ready,&rdquo; replied Lieutenant Sienna Brooks, her fingers flying over the terminal as she prepared the shuttle for a smooth touchdown. Her face was taut with concern, but she had trained for this—Khyros-7 was a dangerous world, and they all knew that.</p><p>&ldquo;Brace for impact,&rdquo; Elias said, his voice tight. The shuttle’s engines screamed as they fought against the atmosphere, and with a final shudder, it touched down with a heavy thud, sinking slightly into the dusty, cracked earth.</p><p>Elias stood, taking a deep breath before opening the hatch. The scent of burnt ozone and something more organic filled the air, making his stomach churn. They were on the outskirts of the colony, and there was no welcoming committee in sight.</p><p>&ldquo;Stay close, keep your helmets on,&rdquo; Elias ordered, stepping out onto the barren landscape.</p><p>The ground beneath their feet was brittle, as though it hadn’t seen water in centuries. The sky, a deep, swirling mix of purples and oranges, cast a haunting glow over everything. As the team stepped onto the surface, their boots made sharp, echoing sounds in the dead silence of the planet. The eerie quiet was oppressive, a stark contrast to the storm that had just passed.</p><p>Elias scanned the horizon, trying to make sense of what he was seeing. The buildings ahead were skeletal, their foundations cracked and buckling. There were no signs of life, no movement—nothing. It looked as though the colony had been abandoned for years, not just weeks.</p><p>&ldquo;Something’s wrong,&rdquo; Sienna muttered under her breath, her eyes fixed on the half-collapsed structure in the distance.</p><p>Elias nodded grimly. &ldquo;We move forward, stay alert.&rdquo;</p><p>They made their way toward the colony, their boots crunching over the uneven terrain. As they approached the central hub of the colony, Elias saw the first signs of destruction—burn marks, scorch marks on the walls of the once-thriving research complex. No one had come out here to salvage anything. The research equipment was left behind, now rusting in the open air.</p><p>&ldquo;Look at this,&rdquo; Lieutenant Brooks said, crouching next to a piece of equipment. It was a data terminal, but the screen was cracked, and the wires hanging out of it looked fried. &ldquo;This wasn’t just a power outage. This was intentional.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who would do something like this?&rdquo; Sergeant Liam Cole asked, his voice hushed as he surveyed the wreckage.</p><p>&ldquo;That’s what we need to find out,&rdquo; Elias replied, turning to scan the area. There were no signs of bodies, no fresh graves. It was as though the entire population had simply vanished.</p><p>As they moved deeper into the colony, they stumbled upon something that sent a chill down their spines—a group of humanoid figures, hunched and still, as if they had been frozen in place.</p><p>&ldquo;Are those…&rdquo; Sienna’s voice trailed off.</p><p>Elias stepped closer, scanning the figures. Their clothing was tattered, and their eyes were wide open, their gazes unblinking. There was something unnatural about the way they stood—rigid, as if they had been petrified. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not moving. Let’s keep our distance for now.&rdquo;</p><p>The air felt thick, as though it was harder to breathe here. Every step felt heavier, as though the very ground was resisting their presence. The unsettling silence was now coupled with an oppressive atmosphere that seemed to weigh on them all. Elias could feel the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end.</p><p>They continued through the colony, finding more and more abandoned buildings, but no signs of human life. Finally, they reached what appeared to be the central command hub. The doors were ajar, and inside, there were traces of hurried departure—disheveled paperwork, food containers left behind, and a flickering terminal still running.</p><p>Sienna approached the terminal, her fingers expertly running over the keyboard, trying to access any data that might explain what had happened. Her face paled as she pulled up a file.</p><p>&ldquo;Elias, you need to see this,&rdquo; she said, stepping back. Elias moved quickly to her side.</p><p>The file was labeled &ldquo;Final Report: Containment Breach.&rdquo; Elias clicked it open, and his eyes scanned the document.</p><p>&ldquo;It was supposed to be a scientific colony,&rdquo; Elias muttered, as he read aloud the chilling words. &ldquo;The research on the native flora and fauna was progressing well until… until they discovered something beneath the surface.&rdquo;</p><p>Beneath the surface?</p><p>The report described an unknown organism discovered deep underground—something that had been dormant for centuries. As the colony’s scientists had begun to study the organism, things began to go wrong. Several personnel reported strange symptoms—severe fatigue, hallucinations, and a rapid decline in health. The more they studied it, the more aggressive the organism seemed to become, extending its influence into the colony’s population.</p><p>Elias felt a cold shiver run down his spine as he continued reading. The organism had some kind of parasitic effect, taking over the bodies of those who were exposed.</p><p>&ldquo;An alien infection?&rdquo; Sienna whispered, barely audible.</p><p>&ldquo;It sounds like it,&rdquo; Elias agreed, his mind racing. &ldquo;But what happened to the rest of the colony?&rdquo;</p><p>Before he could answer, there was a noise—a soft scrape of metal against metal—coming from deep within the complex. Elias motioned for the team to stay silent and approached the sound, his weapon drawn.</p><p>They turned a corner and came face-to-face with a nightmare.</p><p>A figure stood there, hunched over, its back arched unnaturally. Its skin was pale and mottled, its eyes vacant and empty. It had once been human, but now it was something else entirely. The alien organism had taken over, twisting and contorting the body into something grotesque. The creature’s limbs were elongated, and it moved with a jerky, unsettling gait.</p><p>Elias’s heart raced. &ldquo;Get back!&rdquo; he shouted to the team, as the creature screeched and lunged forward, its mouth gaping wide.</p><p>The team opened fire, the sound of blaster shots echoing through the corridors. The creature screeched in pain but didn’t stop. It charged relentlessly, its movements erratic and unpredictable. Finally, with a well-placed shot, Elias hit the creature in the center of its chest, and it crumpled to the floor, motionless.</p><p>A heavy silence followed.</p><p>&ldquo;Is it over?&rdquo; Liam asked, his voice shaky.</p><p>&ldquo;For now,&rdquo; Elias answered, his voice tight with uncertainty. &ldquo;But this is only one of them. The rest of the colony could be in the same condition.&rdquo;</p><p>Elias took a moment to compose himself, staring at the lifeless creature on the floor. The alien organism had spread through the colony, infecting those who came into contact with it. It was a silent, insidious predator, capable of controlling its host, bending them to its will. The team had only seen the beginning.</p><p>&ldquo;We need to find out how far the infection has spread,&rdquo; Elias said, his voice resolute. &ldquo;And we need to find a way to stop it before it reaches other colonies.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo; Sienna said, her face grim. &ldquo;But what about the rest of the survivors?&rdquo;</p><p>Elias paused. &ldquo;We may not find any. But we can’t give up. We owe it to them to finish what we started.&rdquo;</p><p>And so, the survivors of the last colony on Khyros-7 prepared to face the unknown, determined to uncover the truth behind the invasion and find a way to stop the parasitic force before it could spread beyond the planet.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/science-fiction/>Science Fiction</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-last-colony-survival-in-a-dying-universe/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Last Colony: Survival in a Dying Universe</span>
