The quiet hum of the refrigerator was the only sound in the room, yet her mind swirled loudly with memories, thoughts, and questions she still didn’t know how to answer. A cup of tea sat untouched in front of her, its warmth long faded, like the energy drained from her after yet another incident that left her questioning the society around her—and her role within it.</p><p>It had happened earlier that day in the staff meeting. Maya worked as a copy editor at a mid-sized publishing company, and, despite being one of the best at what she did, she was also one of the few people of color in the office. The meeting had started predictably, a parade of bullet points about deadlines and workflow. Then, as the team discussed an upcoming book focused on social justice, a heated debate arose around the cover design.</p><p>“It shouldn’t be so loud,” one of her colleagues had said when discussing a bold visual concept. &ldquo;We want it to feel relevant but not too… aggressive. People won’t respond to that.&rdquo;</p><p>The comment was followed by murmurs of agreement, but Maya couldn’t help but notice how everyone avoided looking in her direction. She recognized that particular brand of discomfort immediately: an eagerness to appear open-minded while simultaneously fleeing from the actual work of confronting bias. The room grew heavy with an unspoken expectation. She was usually the one who broke these silences, offering a perspective that others couldn’t—or wouldn’t—voice. But today, Maya hesitated.</p><p>She stared at the polished conference table, her heart thudding as her mind raced. Should she say something? Call out the implicit bias in using words like “loud” and “aggressive” to describe a project rooted in Black perspectives? Or would speaking up only isolate her further? The weight of the room pressed against her ribs, and for once, she chose to remain silent.</p><p>Now, hours later, the regret gnawed at her. Her silence hadn’t felt like self-preservation—it had felt like complicity. She rubbed her temples, trying to push away the familiar, hollow ache. Confronting these moments came with a cost, but so did staying quiet. The weight of silence could feel heavier than words ever could.</p><hr><p>The next morning, as Maya walked into the office, she forced herself to smile, even though she was still unsettled. She passed coworkers on her way to her desk, exchanging brief pleasantries. Most of them seemed oblivious to what had transpired yesterday; after all, to them, it had been just another meeting. But for Maya, it was a reflection of the deeply ingrained patterns she encountered every day.</p><p>On her desk was a memo from marketing, asking for feedback on the social justice book’s branding. She picked it up and skimmed the language. Words like &ldquo;universal&rdquo; and &ldquo;palatable audience appeal&rdquo; jumped out at her. Her shoulders sagged. Once again, she saw it for what it was: the careful sanitizing of a message that risked making people uncomfortable. It struck her how often these phrases were used to downplay the realities of racism under the guise of keeping things “neutral.”</p><p>Maya glanced toward her coworker Celia, who sat two desks away. Celia was a white woman in her thirties, well-meaning but hesitant in conversations about race. They had shared polite exchanges about lunch spots and weekend plans, but nothing deeper. Maya considered bringing up the memo, half-hoping for some shared outrage, but checked herself. Did Celia ever have to weigh decisions like these so carefully? Did she feel the same suffocating dread about spoiling office relationships?</p><p>“Hey, Maya.” The voice startled her. It was Ryan, the project manager for the book in question. “Do you have a minute?” He motioned toward his office.</p><p>She nodded, following him into the small, windowless room. A thick stack of design proofs sat on his desk, and he gestured for her to sit down across from him.</p><p>“I wanted to get your take on something,” he began, his tone too casual—like someone trying to defuse a bomb but pretending it wasn’t there. “We’re still refining the messaging for the book, and I realized we don’t really have, um, your perspective. You know, as someone who might…have better insight into this audience.”</p><p>There it was. The subtle othering. Ryan might not have meant it maliciously, but Maya felt the sting of being reduced to a proxy for an entire racial identity. She took a deep breath, willing herself to remain calm.</p><p>“Well,” she said carefully, “I guess the question is, who are we expecting to resonate with this book? And why does it seem like we’re trying so hard not to offend anyone?”</p><p>Ryan blinked, as though startled by the directness of her response. “I wouldn’t say we’re trying not to offend,” he hedged. “We just want the message to be… accessible.”</p><p>Maya leaned forward, her frustration finally bubbling to the surface. “Accessible to whom? Because when we strip away anything that might make people uncomfortable, we’re also erasing the voices and experiences this book is supposed to represent. Isn’t the whole point of social justice to confront discomfort, rather than avoid it?”</p><p>Ryan looked at her in silence, the faintest hint of color rising in his cheeks. “I hadn’t thought about it like that,” he admitted after a long pause. “Maybe we need to reevaluate how we’re approaching this.”</p><p>Maya nodded, her pulse racing. Speaking up still felt risky, but in this moment, it also felt necessary.</p><hr><p>That evening, Maya met her best friend, Lila, at their favorite coffee shop. Lila, an artist and fellow advocate for racial equity, greeted her with a warm smile and two lattes.</p><p>“Rough day?” Lila asked, reading the tension in Maya’s face.</p><p>“You could say that,” Maya replied, slumping into the chair. She recounted the events of the past two days, the stifling atmosphere of the meeting, her initial silence, and her later conversation with Ryan.</p><p>Lila listened intently, nodding as she sipped her latte. “You know,” she said thoughtfully, “it’s not just about the moments when we speak up or stay silent. It’s also about what happens afterward. You planted a seed with Ryan today. Maybe he’ll see things differently next time. Change doesn’t happen all at once.”</p><p>Maya sighed. “I just wish it didn’t always feel like this uphill battle. Like I have to keep choosing between protecting my own peace and pushing for something better.”</p><p>“You’re not alone in this,” Lila reminded her. “Every time you speak up, you’re part of something bigger. The weight isn’t just on you—it’s on all of us who care about justice.”</p><p>Maya felt a small flicker of hope. The weight of silence might be heavy, but it wasn’t immovable. And perhaps, with enough voices rising together, it could be lifted entirely.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/racism-and-prejudice/>Racism and Prejudice</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-weight-of-color-personal-narratives-on-racism/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Weight of Color: Personal Narratives on Racism</span>
