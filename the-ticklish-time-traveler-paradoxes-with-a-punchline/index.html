True, he had spent years working on his brilliant machine crafted to catapult him into yesteryears with a gentle plonk. And, yes, he reveled in the glory of history quite unlike anyone else. Yet the wondrous world of the past served a purpose far greater than mere opportunistic tourism. Each tick, tock, and swing of the pendulum brought him an answer.</p><p>If he&rsquo;d strolled into a Victorian ball or curtsied in the mahogany-paneled parlor of what is now known as the Smithsonian, you might say, &ldquo;Ah, another eccentric.&rdquo; But Docile had a unique mission, his soul-drawn road map destined to lead him through time&rsquo;s labyrinth to discover the key to everlasting happiness.</p><p>Humdrum never trickled in his veins, nor did monotony ever dare to drape its dreary cloth over his shoulder like a somber, miniature Matilda. Nay, Docile heaved a yawn not because the world had nothing more to offer. Instead, he reveled in an overdose of life. Armies of laughter had filled his lungs, and fathomless beauty had smudged his eyes like poolside shadows. He did not seek serenity on his odyssey. His search was for a high note, a crescendo of joy hard to match (if not beat).</p><p>Stevie Twist, the man who first conceived time as a series of cat&rsquo;s cradles (not the toy, but the actual strands composed of all experiences), was not in his own time. Docile needed to unravel the riddle of time, which he believed would lead him straight to that elusive crescendo.</p><p>Through the swirling vortex of the past, the future, and the present, his machine sang its symphony. And so it came to pass that time was tickled into transporting the expectant astronaut to an epoch marked by the first smidgens of what would blossom into the prolific genius of Stevie Twist.</p><p>Docile, in this era, first inhabited the rickety shell of the mind that housed the budding innovator&rsquo;s intellect. Not unlike the mechanical beast that bore him to this juncture, Twist&rsquo;s cerebrum was in its nascent stages. The ticklish time-traveler reveled in the unborn architect of the cosmos thrashing out chaos into order from his noggin.</p><p>Docile could not help but twitch as Tele-Twist, as he called himself, smiled dimples-deep as he solved an equation with an unseasoned flourish.</p><p>&ldquo;Ticklish?&rdquo; Tele-Twist scoffed, flashing steely grey eyes at Docile. &ldquo;Nay, it&rsquo;s simply the taste of brilliance that all who wander into the land of numbers must savor.&rdquo;</p><p>Docile gulped, swallowed his laughter, and ventured on. Tickling time&rsquo;s backbone, he traced Stevie Twist&rsquo;s development from an awkward adolescent, prodding, poking, turning over life&rsquo;s stones to witness each wriggling discovery.</p><p>One day, in the midst of a happenstance encounter with a sultry maiden prone to pining over a lute, he espied the reflection of a man who resembled himself, albeit by the measure of his spirit and manner. &ldquo;Mirrors, such curious constructs of time and space,&rdquo; muttered Tele-Twist. &ldquo;Always reflect not what is, but what might be. – Or what is to become.&rdquo;</p><p>The shy apparition in the glass began to unfurl, heeding Stevie&rsquo;s words and embodying the seeker Docile had become. Tele-Twist rattled off equations and theories to no end, to the point where if one were not aware of the passage of time, he might have mistaken Docile for the younger self of the man in the glass.</p><p>Yet, such an occurrence, were it to transpire, would jostle the jigsaw of existence like a vibration within the timeless symphony, and none would be the wiser, until all time stood bald and sore; worse, till all time crumbled under its paradoxical weight.</p><p>Distressed by his own temporally entwined reflections, Docile resolved to bury this past-self within the warm womb of history, sealing him from witnessing their echo. Should such a confluence occur, ripples of staggering potency might spawn a requiem not only for Stevie Twist but for time itself.</p><p>Unbeknownst to Docile, his actions would not be so easily shrouded. Fate, for all its wit and trickery, would orchestrate a preface to the finale – a dance not unlike those reminders at the beginning of operas, wherein a pianist scurries about wondering, &ldquo;Is this right?&rdquo;</p><p>On a fateful day that marked both an eta and a zeta, Docile discovered his past-self among a pack of scholars engaged in celestial banter. Tele-Twist had invited both, ready to share his latest and perhaps final treatise on the fabric of time. &ldquo;The ancestors of time shall awaken,&rdquo; Tele-Twist declared, a perceptive twinkle veritably tickling his eye. &ldquo;How ticklish,&rdquo; he chuckled, &ldquo;to think we shall soon navigate such Lore.&rdquo;</p><p>As they neared the crescendo of their discourse, eerie echoes multiplied and whirled – the hair on Docile&rsquo;s wrist raised like chickling minnows. Tele-Twist noticed nothing out of the ordinary, simply marveling at his own brilliance and perhaps the deeply interwoven strands that these three souls, entangled without knowing it, had spun into existence.</p><p>Docile sensed a powerful tremor, wires tighter than violin strings, stretching from Tele-Twist to the aloof image of the man now sharing the room, himself – all but his knowledge, a mere silhouette awaiting the cascade of wisdom.</p><p>With one jarring stretch, a fallacy came to life, a paradox burst its bonds, and time itself taunted the three together. Tele-Twist gleefully watched as Docile&rsquo;s ghost-self and he exchanged genial contemplations, splitting into two ever-shifting reflections, whispering words and hidden mathematics, interweaving like a mischievous dance.</p><p>Such a tactic stroke Docile&rsquo;s murky inclinations to distract Tele-Twist. In his distracting guise, however, he perceived Tele-Twist&rsquo;s gnawing suspicion that the ever-shifting reflections bore an echo, an imperceptible semblance of himself leavened by the tasting-touch of Docile&rsquo;s laughter.</p><p>Tele-Twist, forever the trailblazer of time, found his own theory unraveling before his eyes – Time&rsquo;s fabric, woven by twist and twirl, lost its draught and unraveled under the shocking gaze of this juxtaposition.</p><p>&ldquo;Tickling me,&rdquo; Tele-Twist accused, his smile dissolving as the tickle traveled up his spine. Reality teetered, striving to maintain its fragile state while chaos clawed its way forth.</p><p>To quell its dissonant tremble, reality required Docile to extinguish his playful light, to fade away like children&rsquo;s laughter in the noon-day sun. Erase the imprint of his words and his laughter, illusions as they were.</p><p>Paradoxically quelled within the dunce of his former self, Docile withdrew. As the little glimpse of the past-self disappeared behind the ramparts of memory followed by time&rsquo;s cruel lick of erasure, Tele-Twist&rsquo;s indignant utterance echoed with certain finality.</p><p>&ldquo;Tickling or no, time cannot be infinite.&rdquo; Then he muttered, perhaps as much to himself, the echo of which echoed through the hollow chambers of Docile&rsquo;s being, a haunting refrain of laughter.</p><p>With his final brush against the ticklish fabric of time, Docile launched himself back to his mechanical chariot, whose instrument bore him to an time and space comfortably beyond his reach. The singular laughter of Stevie Twist now sounded far sweeter than any crescendo, and more reminiscent of an echo than Docile had expected.</p><p>For, as the Time Traveler slumbered under the blanket of his mechanical womb, he gave a knowing smile. Oh, the infinite tickling. Tickled by the future and the past, he felt the warmth of time&rsquo;s giggles reverberate against his skin – a glorious marriage of laughter transcending bounds not barred by tick or tock or spin.</p><p>As Docile&rsquo;s mechanical pulse quieted, he whispered to himself, &ldquo;Tickling time&rsquo;s nod, I&rsquo;ve gleaned the joy. Tickling and perpetuating, this journey&rsquo;s never-ending.&rdquo; His laughter echoed, embraced by the cosmos, the universe resounding with a symphony incomprehensibly fitting for all boundless beings, everywhere.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/comedy-and-humor/>Comedy and Humor</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-surprise-party-fiasco-laughter-and-chaos-unleashed/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Surprise Party Fiasco: Laughter and Chaos Unleashed</span>
