As the applause for the young athlete reverberated through the stands, the cameras flashed like storm clouds illuminated by lightning bolts, capturing every moment of his meteoric ascent.</p><p>The once-small and unknown town of Glenhaven had become the epicenter of a sports phenomenon, its name on the lips of every sports enthusiast and casual observer alike.
