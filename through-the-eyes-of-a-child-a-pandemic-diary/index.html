I knew something was about to change big time because on that same day, a strange man wearing a white coat and a mask showed up on our doorstep. His name was Mr. Bryson, and he represented the beginning of the end of normal life. At first, we hid from him, uncertain if we were safe or not.</p><p>&ldquo;Please, let me speak to your parents,&rdquo; he implored gently. His eyes peeked out from behind his mask, searching for a kindly reception. No one budged. The terror had gripped every single one of us, adults and children alike. His words, while masked by his unfamiliar countenance, made me think of the scary movies my older brother used to watch when he wanted to creep me out.</p><p>The silence continued for several more minutes, until finally, my mom stepped forward and place a trembling hand on my shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, come in,&rdquo; she quivered, retreating back to the kitchen to take shelter in her tears. That was the day when everything started to change.</p><p>In a matter of weeks, we all got used to life under the global quarantine. School moved online, and playdates at the park disappeared. Everywhere you looked on TV there were doctors and nurses working tirelessly, trying to save lives and put an end to the chaos.</p><p>Magic crept into every little corner of our home as my mom, dad, and sister each took turns researching everything about the virus. The stakes were high. One slip-up, one wrong move, and you could be family-less within a matter of days. We learned to wash our hands like doctors, wore masks when we had to sneak outside, and practiced social distancing like it was our lives depending on it: Because, well, it kind of did.</p><p>With distance learning, I went online and so did my best friend, little Emma. Our friendship deepened as we spent hours talking about our shared pain, fears, and what crazy stuff we thought would happen next. She was the one to introduce me to the days of the week for our pretend birthdays.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think Wednesday would be the perfect day to have a mini birthday party? We can pretend we&rsquo;re going to Aunt Kathy&rsquo;s for cake!&rdquo; Emma&rsquo;s eyes wouldn&rsquo;t stop sparkling at the thought, and so convinced I became.</p><p>The days genuinely blipped by, like fish swimming upstream to the sea of hope for normalcy, trailing behind each other faster than we could dry our tears.</p><p>One day, after weeks of isolation, I began to see things differently. A flower that had pushed its way up from beneath the concrete sidewalk, refusing to give up its place in the sun beaming down from the heavens above. The way the birds would perch on the wire and sing in the early dawn, loudly drowning out the city&rsquo;s din.</p><p>I was a symbol of hope, and a spark in eyes ready to redefine what a good and meaningful life looked like, all among the chaos of their own. I realized with sparkling eyes of my own that there will be a time when this will all be merely a collection of memories, bonded together like a chain linking us through to the future in which we will one day walk together. So, we must embrace these moments in its entirety and never forget, but always remember what it was like experiencing this that will shape us in times ahead.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/pandemic-stories/>Pandemic Stories</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/through-the-empty-cities-pandemic-journeys/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Through the Empty Cities: Pandemic Journeys</span>
