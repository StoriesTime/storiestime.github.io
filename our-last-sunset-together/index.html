In the distance, waves lazily brushed against the shore, their rhythm slow and predictable, as though the sea itself were aware of the gravity of this moment. The air carried the tang of salt and the faint aroma of wild jasmine that grew along the edge of the dunes. I stood ankle-deep in the sand, holding her hand, feeling its warmth fading with every passing second.</p><p>“Look how beautiful it is,” she murmured, her voice barely above a whisper. &ldquo;I almost forgot how much I loved sunsets.&rdquo;</p><p>She tilted her head back slightly, letting the breeze play with her hair. It caught the setting sunlight just so, framing her in shimmering gold, like she was part of the landscape itself—part of the fleeting beauty destined to fade away too soon. I didn’t respond. Words felt like intrusions in a moment as raw and fragile as this.</p><p>Her name was Elena. For five years, she had been the constant against which the chaos of my life seemed to stabilize. When my job became too much to bear, when the world pushed in on me from every direction, she stood firm. She was my sanctuary, my North Star. And now, as the last great light of the day bled out across the skyline, I wondered how I was supposed to carry on knowing this was the last time—our last sunset together.</p><p>I tightened my grip on her hand, needing her to anchor me. She gave my fingers a gentle squeeze in return, her way of reminding me to let go. &ldquo;You’re going to be okay, Daniel,&rdquo; she said softly. I didn&rsquo;t believe her.</p><p>She knelt, slipping her feet free of her sandals and burying her toes in the cool sand where the tide had left its gentle sting of moisture. I joined her wordlessly, our shoulders touching as we sat side by side, watching the waves crest and break. She had always loved the ocean; it was where we first met. A mutual friend had dragged me to a crowded beach party on a hot summer night. I had lost interest in the festivities almost immediately and wandered closer to the shore, where I found her building a sandcastle long after dark.</p><p>&ldquo;You’re too old for sandcastles,&rdquo; I had teased her.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; she had replied, without looking up. &ldquo;But you’re never too old for stories.&rdquo;</p><p>That was who she was—a storyteller, a dreamer who believed the sea whispered secrets if you knew how to listen. She told me her favorite sunsets were the ones that seemed almost alive, as though holding their breath at the edge of dusk before plunging into the abyss of night. This was one of those sunsets.</p><p>Elena tilted her head toward me, her green eyes catching the last glimmers of daylight. &ldquo;Do you remember what I told you that night?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You told me that everyone has a favorite regret,&rdquo; I said without hesitation. &ldquo;And that I&rsquo;d be yours.&rdquo; A hint of a smile played on her lips, bittersweet and fleeting.</p><p>It was no secret that what had brought us together was as much a miracle as a calamity. We had met during a time when both of us were lost, two broken compasses spinning wildly in search of direction. She had been engaged to someone else. I was still tethered to a past relationship by threads of guilt and obligation. What began as stolen conversations over coffee turned into a wildfire that consumed us both. For years, we had tried to justify it to ourselves, insisting that love like ours couldn’t be wrong. Or maybe we were simply too selfish to let go.</p><p>But now the inevitability we had always avoided had come to claim us.</p><p>&ldquo;It’s better this way,&rdquo; she murmured. It sounded like an apology.</p><p>I wanted to argue, to plead, to tell her we could find another way, but we both knew better. Her fiancé was waiting for her flight to touch down in Paris tomorrow morning. She would start a new life, one that didn’t include the chaos we had created together. And I, too, would have to learn to live again without her.</p><p>The sun sank lower, its light reflecting across the water in a fiery golden path that seemed to stretch endlessly toward the sky. I wanted to tell her how much I would miss her, how the thought of mornings without her laughter felt unbearable. Instead, my voice betrayed me, cracking as I said the only thing I could manage, “You were my favorite regret too.”</p><p>For a long moment, she didn’t respond, and I wasn’t sure if she would. Then she turned to face me fully, resting her palm against my cheek. It was a gesture as tender as it was devastating. Her touch lingered, her thumb brushing away a tear I hadn’t realized had slipped free. &ldquo;I’ll carry this with me,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Always.&rdquo;</p><p>The sun dipped beneath the horizon, taking the last remnants of its warmth with it. The once-vivid hues dissolved into muted purples and grays, and the first faint stars began to appear in the twilight sky. It was done. The moment we had both dreaded yet silently longed for had passed, leaving behind the hollow ache of finality.</p><p>Neither of us spoke as we walked back across the dunes toward the waiting car. In the fading light, our shadows stretched long and thin, wavering like fragile strands of memory threatening to disappear at the slightest gust of wind. She held my hand until the very last second, and when her fingers finally slipped free, it felt like the end of the world.</p><p>The drive back to her apartment was silent, save for the quiet hum of the engine. My thoughts raced, but I knew better than to chase them. Every word I could say felt inadequate, a futile attempt to stitch together the gaping wounds we were leaving behind.</p><p>When we arrived, she leaned over and kissed me on the cheek. It was tender and cold all at once, like a winter breeze. &ldquo;Goodbye, Daniel,&rdquo; she said, her voice soft but resolute. Then she stepped out of the car and disappeared through the door without looking back.</p><p>I sat there for what felt like hours, the weight of her absence pressing down on my chest. The world kept turning, indifferent to the grief that now tethered me to this quiet, empty moment. Eventually, I started the engine and pulled away from the curb, driving aimlessly through the city until the night consumed me.</p><p>Even now, months later, I often find myself on the shoreline at sunset, hoping to catch a glimpse of the beauty she loved so much. The sea, the sky, the fading light—they all feel different without her. Some days, I like to believe that in another life, another story, we remain together, building sandcastles beneath the glow of a sun that never sets. But in this life, I carry the memory of Elena and our last sunset together, like a candle flickering against the wind, until it is extinguished completely.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/love-and-heartbreak/>Love and Heartbreak</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/loving-you-was-my-greatest-mistake/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Loving You Was My Greatest Mistake</span>
