Streetlamps flickered and sputtered as the wind howled between the trees, their branches like skeletal arms reaching into the night sky. The houses along the street stood in a row, each an exact mirror of the others: well-kept lawns, white picket fences, and warm lights glowing through the windows. It was the kind of place where everyone knew everyone, and secrets were often buried under a thin veil of suburban civility.</p><p>But tonight, Hawthorne Drive would be anything but peaceful.</p><hr><p>Detective Eliza Marlowe had seen her fair share of gruesome crime scenes, but this one was different. It wasn&rsquo;t the brutality of the murder that unsettled her, though that was certainly alarming. It wasn&rsquo;t the mystery surrounding the victim either, though that was certainly puzzling. No, it was the way the house looked. It felt wrong in a way that went beyond the obvious. It was as if the house itself had been violated.</p><p>As she stood at the front door of 45 Hawthorne Drive, Eliza couldn&rsquo;t shake the unsettling sensation creeping up her spine. Her instincts told her something was off. The air was heavy, thick with an unknown presence. The door was slightly ajar, an invitation to enter, yet it felt more like a warning. She pushed it open and stepped inside, the floor creaking beneath her feet.</p><p>&ldquo;Detective Marlowe,&rdquo; a voice called from the hallway, pulling her out of her thoughts. She turned to find Officer Thomas, a young cop with a serious look on his face.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the situation?&rdquo; Eliza asked, her voice steady but sharp.</p><p>&ldquo;Victim&rsquo;s a man, mid-forties,&rdquo; Thomas said, leading her down the hall. &ldquo;His name’s Richard Hollis. Apparently, he’s well-liked in the neighborhood. No signs of forced entry, but his wife found him this morning, lying in the kitchen.&rdquo;</p><p>Eliza nodded, her eyes scanning the surroundings. The house was immaculate, almost too pristine. There was no sign of a struggle, no overturned furniture, no chaos. Everything was in its place, except for the body. The kitchen was small, cozy even, but it was the scene of a nightmare. Richard Hollis lay sprawled across the cold tiles, his face contorted in pain. Blood pooled beneath him, dark and thick, staining the white floor like a scar.</p><p>&ldquo;Was he shot?&rdquo; Eliza asked, crouching beside the body, her eyes flicking over every detail.</p><p>&ldquo;No, no gunshot wounds,&rdquo; Thomas replied. &ldquo;The coroner says it looks like he was strangled. No weapon found so far.&rdquo;</p><p>Eliza stood up, her mind racing. Strangulation. It was personal, intimate. Someone had been close to Richard when he died. Someone who had likely known him well.</p><p>&ldquo;Any signs of forced entry?&rdquo; Eliza asked again, though she already suspected the answer.</p><p>Thomas shook his head. &ldquo;Nothing. All the windows and doors were locked. No signs of struggle inside the house, either.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That means the killer was either already inside or knew Richard well enough to gain access without raising suspicion,&rdquo; Eliza mused. &ldquo;What about the wife?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s in shock,&rdquo; Thomas said. &ldquo;Her name’s Claire. She was at a yoga class when the murder happened. Came back to find the body.&rdquo;</p><p>Eliza nodded thoughtfully. &ldquo;I’ll speak with her.&rdquo;</p><hr><p>Claire Hollis sat in the living room, her hands trembling as she clutched a cup of tea. She looked up at Eliza as she entered, her pale face drawn with exhaustion and worry.</p><p>&ldquo;Mrs. Hollis,&rdquo; Eliza said gently, taking a seat across from her. &ldquo;I know this is hard, but I need to ask you a few questions.&rdquo;</p><p>Claire nodded silently, her eyes distant. &ldquo;I&mldr; I don’t understand. Richard&mldr; he was fine. He was just fine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know this is difficult,&rdquo; Eliza said, her voice soft but firm. &ldquo;But I need to know, was your husband expecting anyone last night? Anyone who might have come by?&rdquo;</p><p>Claire shook her head slowly. &ldquo;No, no one. Richard didn&rsquo;t have any visitors. He was home alone most of the evening. I went to my yoga class, like I always do on Monday nights.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did your husband ever mention anyone he was having problems with?&rdquo; Eliza pressed, watching for any sign of recognition or hesitation.</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Claire said quickly, her eyes darting away. &ldquo;Richard&mldr; he never talked about work much. He had a high-paying job at a law firm, but he didn’t like discussing it. We didn’t have problems. At least, I thought we didn’t.&rdquo;</p><p>Eliza noted the shift in Claire’s tone. There was something there—something hidden behind the words. &ldquo;Were there any issues in your marriage?&rdquo; she asked, her voice more pointed now.</p><p>Claire flinched but quickly composed herself. &ldquo;No, we were fine. I loved him, and he loved me. Everything was perfect.&rdquo;</p><p>Eliza’s instincts flared. People didn’t often say everything was perfect unless there was something they were trying to cover up. &ldquo;Is there anyone who might want to hurt Richard?&rdquo; she asked, her gaze fixed on Claire.</p><p>Claire’s lips trembled. &ldquo;I don’t know&mldr; I really don’t know. Maybe&mldr; maybe his business partner, Alan. They’ve been working together for years, but I’ve seen them argue recently. Richard said something about Alan being difficult to deal with, but he didn’t go into details.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Alan?&rdquo; Eliza repeated, noting the name. &ldquo;Where can I find him?&rdquo;</p><hr><p>It wasn’t hard to locate Alan Maxwell. He was the kind of man who seemed to leave a trail wherever he went: big personality, expensive tastes, and a tendency to make enemies along the way. When Eliza arrived at his office, a sleek, glass-walled building in the heart of downtown, she could see why Richard had been frustrated with him. Alan’s office was pristine, immaculate, and filled with expensive art pieces that screamed wealth and arrogance.</p><p>&ldquo;Detective Marlowe, I presume?&rdquo; Alan said, his voice smooth but laced with irritation as he stood to greet her. His hand was firm, but his eyes were cold.</p><p>&ldquo;I’m investigating the murder of Richard Hollis,&rdquo; Eliza said bluntly. &ldquo;I understand you two were business partners.&rdquo;</p><p>Alan’s face tightened, but he quickly recovered. &ldquo;Richard and I were partners, yes. We built our firm from the ground up, but we weren’t exactly friends. We had our differences.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Care to elaborate?&rdquo; Eliza asked, folding her arms across her chest.</p><p>Alan sighed, sitting back down behind his polished desk. &ldquo;Richard was always the more conservative one. He wanted to play it safe, keep things slow and steady. I wanted to take risks, push the firm to the next level. There was tension, but nothing worth killing over.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where were you last night?&rdquo; Eliza pressed.</p><p>&ldquo;I was at a gala,&rdquo; Alan replied smoothly. &ldquo;You can check the guest list. I was there all evening.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who can confirm that?&rdquo; Eliza asked, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>&ldquo;Several people,&rdquo; Alan said, his smile thin. &ldquo;It was a high-profile event. You can ask anyone who was there.&rdquo;</p><p>Eliza wasn’t convinced. &ldquo;We’ll check. In the meantime, I want to know if Richard ever mentioned anything specific about you being involved in his death.&rdquo;</p><p>Alan’s expression faltered for just a moment. &ldquo;Detective, you’re wasting your time. I didn’t kill Richard. I’m not a killer. I may have had my disagreements with him, but murder? No. That’s not me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then why don’t you tell me the truth about what happened between you two?&rdquo; Eliza asked, her voice sharp as she turned to leave.</p><hr><p>The next few days were a blur of interviews and dead ends. Eliza couldn’t shake the feeling that something was missing, something important. The pieces weren’t adding up. Claire Hollis seemed genuinely shocked, but there was that small flicker of something in her eyes that Eliza couldn’t ignore. Alan Maxwell had an alibi, but it wasn’t airtight. Every lead she followed brought her back to square one.</p><p>It wasn’t until she reviewed the autopsy report that she finally saw it. Richard’s body showed signs of trauma not just from strangulation, but from blunt force. A small bruise on his temple—a subtle mark that had been overlooked at first glance.</p><p>Aha.</p><p>The answer had been staring her in the face all along.</p><p>Eliza returned to Claire Hollis’ home, her mind made up. She sat down with the distraught wife once again, this time with a sense of certainty.</p><p>&ldquo;Claire, we found something,&rdquo; Eliza said, her voice steady but intense. &ldquo;Richard didn’t just die from strangulation. He was struck on the head first, and then he was strangled.&rdquo;</p><p>Claire’s face went pale. &ldquo;What are you implying?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I’m implying that someone tried to knock Richard out before they killed him,&rdquo; Eliza said, her eyes locking onto Claire’s. &ldquo;And I think it was you.&rdquo;</p><p>Claire’s lips trembled, but she didn’t deny it. Instead, she broke down, tears streaming down her face. &ldquo;I didn’t mean to kill him,&rdquo; she sobbed. &ldquo;But he&mldr; he was going to leave me. He had been seeing someone else, and I couldn’t handle it. He was so cold, so distant&mldr; I couldn’t let him go.&rdquo;</p><p>Eliza remained silent as Claire confessed everything: the affair, the arguments, the fear of losing everything. In a moment of desperation, Claire had struck Richard in a fit of rage, and when he tried to fight back, she strangled him.</p><p>Hawthorne Drive had always seemed like the perfect neighborhood. But behind its neat facades and manicured lawns, darkness lurked, waiting to be uncovered.</p><hr><p>The case was closed, but for Eliza Marlowe, the shadows of Hawthorne Drive would linger long after the rain had stopped falling.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/mysteries-and-thrillers/>Mysteries and Thrillers</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/murder-in-the-mist-best-mystery-short-stories/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Murder in the Mist: Best Mystery Short Stories</span>
