Deep beneath its surface, where sunlight faded into a murky bluish glow, lay Kelriun—an underwater kingdom where merfolk thrived amidst coral spires and shimmering aquatic forests that swayed as though in conversation with the tides.</p><p>Among those merfolk was Alenna, a young mermaid with golden hair that cascaded down her back like waterfalls of sunlight. Her tail, a shimmering emerald streak adorned with flecks of silver, reflected the vibrant spirit of the ocean itself. Yet her luminous beauty belied a soul weighed down by longing and a heart tethered to memories she could not dispel.</p><p>Alenna was unlike many of her kin who accepted their lot beneath the waves with reverence, their loyalty bound to the depths that nurtured but also imprisoned them. She had a secret—a forbidden bond with someone who did not belong to their world. Her heart had been conquered by a human sailor named Caius, whose ship frequently passed near Kelriun&rsquo;s borders, grazing the surface of their hidden domain.</p><p>Their love had been an accident born of defiance. Alenna had often ventured into forbidden waters, curious about the life above the waves despite the warnings of her mentor Serath, a weathered, stoic merman who had seen disasters wrought by previous encounters between human and merfolk. It was during one silent dusk, when the sky glowed a faint orange and the sea mirrored its fiery hues, that Alenna first saw Caius, leaning over the ship’s edge, his expression serene as he gazed at the endless expanse of water.</p><p>Their eyes met in that fragile moment, and time seemed to halt. Curiosity grew into conversation, conversation into friendship, and friendship blossomed into a love that defied both land and sea. They would meet whenever the winds were kind and the tides tranquil, exchanging secrets and dreams until the stars dotted the sky. Caius sang sea shanties for her, his voice carried by the ocean breeze as Alenna danced in the waves, her laughter echoing in harmony with the tides.</p><p>But love between realms always carried a burden too heavy to bear. The differences between them were more than the obvious; as a mermaid, Alenna could never remain above the surface for long without weakening, just as Caius would perish if he descended too far beneath the waves. Their worlds were divided by nature’s laws, and both knew there would never be a way to bridge it.</p><p>Their last encounter came during a tempestuous storm, the ocean thrashing with anger as if it, too, disapproved of their union. Caius called out to Alenna through sheets of rain and crashing waves, his voice strained and desperate. Her heart twisted in agony as she surfaced, knowing it could cost her everything.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll return to the sea,&rdquo; Caius had promised her, clutching the side of his swaying ship. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find a way. I won&rsquo;t let this be the end!&rdquo;</p><p>Tears mingled with seawater on Alenna&rsquo;s cheeks, her voice trembling. &ldquo;Caius, you don&rsquo;t belong here! The ocean is merciless to those who aren&rsquo;t bound to it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; he countered with fire in his eyes. &ldquo;I would give it all up—for you, Alenna. For us.&rdquo;</p><p>The waves surged higher, a shadow passing over his ship—one of Kelriun&rsquo;s sentinels who had come to intervene. Serath and his guards acted out of duty, tearing Alenna from the surface as she screamed Caius&rsquo; name, dragging her back to the depths against her will.</p><p>Despite her pleas, Caius was lost to her forever. She learned later from Serath’s somber recounting that his ship had capsized during the storm, scattering the sailors across the raging seas. Caius had dove into the water in search of her, driven by a desperation that outweighed his limbs’ endurance, but the ocean claimed him as its own, swallowing his last breath.</p><p>The news split her heart in two, leaving an empty husk where love had once thrived. Alenna withdrew from her kind, leaving Kelriun for the farther reaches of the abyss, where silence veiled her sorrow like a heavy shroud. She abandoned her laughter, her songs, even her joy, exchanging them for solitary exile among craggy outcroppings and eerie bioluminescent lights in the deep sea.</p><p>Years passed, though it felt like an eternity. Her heart remained an unhealing wound. She often gazed upward from the trenches, her own laments hidden in the sighs of the tides. Though her world retained its beauty—the schools of fish twirling like dancers, the coral alive with color—it was Caius she saw every time the sunlight refracted through the water. It was his voice she heard when the whales sung their mournful dirges.</p><p>But one night, on the anniversary of Caius’ death, Alenna found herself returning to the surface, compelled by some unseen force she couldn’t explain. The moon hung low, casting silvery light onto the rippling water like threads of silk. As she swam upward, breaking through the surface, she saw him—or, at least, what remained of him.</p><p>A broken shipwreck loomed nearby, its mast jutting out like an obelisk of drowned dreams. Attached to the debris was Caius&rsquo; locket, protected unnaturally against time and salt. Alenna reached out with trembling hands, claiming it with reverence. Inside, she found his portrait—a sketch he’d once kept close of her on a scrap of fabric he’d embroidered himself. A smile he’d captured, radiant and alive, greeted her from a happier time.</p><p>Surrounded by quiet waves, Alenna sang again—for the first time in years. Her voice carried with it sorrow and hope, spiraling into the night sky as if searching for him. Though she knew her song would never reach his ears, it wasn’t for him anymore—it was her farewell to a love that shaped her and a loss that had forever changed her.</p><p>Her lament echoed over the waves, resonating with the sea’s eternal rhythm. And though her tears dissolved into the ocean, cascading into the depths, Alenna finally understood. The love she and Caius shared might never have bridged their worlds, but it intertwined their souls—a bond that neither the sea nor time could sever.</p><p>Alenna returned to Kelriun before sunrise, clutching the locket to her chest. The ocean would remain her domain and her cage, but she carried her memories close, no longer with despair but with gratitude for a love that had dared to cross impossible barriers. Beneath the waves, she began to sing again—not just of loss, but of love that perseveres in the face of insurmountable odds.</p><p>Thus, Alenna became a legend among her people, her tale whispered through the tides and carried across the currents. It was said her laments could be heard in the distance, soft and beautiful, touching sailors and merfolk alike—an eternal reminder of the fragile yet powerful connection between love and loss.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/mystical-creatures/>Mystical Creatures</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/magical-encounters-short-stories-of-mythical-beings-and-creatures/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Magical Encounters: Short Stories of Mythical Beings and Creatures</span>
