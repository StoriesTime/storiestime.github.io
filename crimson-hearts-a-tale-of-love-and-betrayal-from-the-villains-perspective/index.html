Beneath the dim glow of flickering lamplight, the busiest district of the city was painted with embarrassment bare, the streets now hushed, the frenetic race of the day finally at rest. Yet a sinister figure crept along those deserted thoroughfares—a figure known as the Scarlet Phantom.</p><p>Tall, cloaked, their movements deceptively fluid—a dance to which death was but a dull partner—the Scarlet Phantom had earned such a name from the crimson hearts, the bloodstained tokens left in the wake of their cruel machinations. And though the faithful citizens of Valoria branded me such, beneath the mask, I confess, lay no soul unblemished by the stain of sin. My name had been Adalric&mldr;once.</p><p>The cold night air whispered through Valoria&rsquo;s cobblestoned alleys as heavily breasted shadows emblazoned the earth with promises of frost; not a soul dared to approach, much less defy the sinister entity that dared to tread upon the streets later than all others. Yet amidst these desolate lanes drawn with the dull blade of despair, candles flickered beyond modest windows.</p><p>A young maiden—no older than eighteen summers—rested against the well-worn frame of her door when she saw me pass—a mere play of shadows that the moonlight barely graced. Our eyes met for a fleeting moment; hers—wide pools ever drawn toward azure skies—jolted my surreptitious prowling. She did not betray an ounce of affright, but something stirred within me, a fluttering fowl escaped from within the unfamiliar realm of my being.</p><p>I passed her residence then, sheerly by chance, yet it was said that fate was the great weaver—the tender hand that unravels the threads entwined in our lives. I turned my eyes away, only looking once more when I heard a soft voice holler from behind me.</p><p>&ldquo;M&rsquo;lord?&rdquo;</p><p>I stopped in my tracks, a gesture more out of surprise than anything else. Here stood a lass—a girl whom I would have passed by without a moment&rsquo;s consideration a fortnight ago—gazing at me with gentle, beseeching eyes. In her right hand, she cradled a candle, its soft light casting the shadows in her eyes to even further mysterious depths. I say there was magic then; some unknown enchantment stirred within my somber heart—one that outweighed the sorrows I had known and inflicted upon others.</p><p>The girl curtsied humbly before me, her voice a tender trilling that pleaded its way into my frozen soul like nothing else could. &ldquo;Might I please have your aid, good sir?&rdquo; she requested, as though I were an actual noble knight and not but a beast of shadow and sorrow, clothed in man&rsquo;s form. I was weary with deceit; such roles had worn ever thin upon my shoulders—the cloak of chivalry feeling as foreign upon me as honor had long ago. Yet still, I could not refuse her.</p><p>&ldquo;What aid is needed, fair lady?&rdquo; I asked, my voice barely more than a raspy whisper. She looked upon me with a strange mixture of gratitude and pity. I marveled that angels could feel empathy for such a wretched creature as myself.</p><p>&ldquo;Pray, gentle sir,&rdquo; she began hesitantly, the weight of her need like an unspoken rebuke to my blackened reputation, &ldquo;my sister be near death—the influenza hath taken her quite abominably. The physician has failed to cure her; I possess but little coin and no influence in society to purchase oneself a true healer. Yet maybe, if you would have mercy upon a simple maiden and her dying sibling, you could&mldr;&rdquo; She seemed to recoil at the thought of asking.</p><p>That was the moment that flames of long-drowned memories rose within me—a time when heart&rsquo;s blood ran hot, nourished by care for kin. I looked away when I sought to hide further from the depths of the self-loathing cloaked in shadows of my past. I, too, had sisters who once laughed and frolicked; I, too, had been blessed with the warmth of a family&rsquo;s love.</p><p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; I said, my voice more confident, more commanding, than before. &ldquo;I shall help you. Lead me to your sister.&rdquo;</p><p>That night, I visited the bedchamber of Gabrielle, the ill maiden. Illuminated only by embers in the hearth, the room seemed like a tempestuous sea of blackness. The moonlight through the high window cast its silver illumination but barely, an eerie glow upon the pale face of Gabrielle upon her sickbed—the life seeming to have left her even as I gazed upon her sweet countenance. There beside her, the young maiden who had come to know me as—against all odds—the bearer of her hope.</p><p>Standing over her, I closed my eyes, and for a brief second, it was not her frail breathing that met my ears, nor the smell of illness that filled the air, but the soft giggling of my own younger sisters. Only their laughter had ever clashed so harmoniously with the lilting serenade of my heart. And, in that moment, amidst the echoes of the past, the once-lost thread of humanity within me was drawn taut once more.</p><p>Then a whisper escaped my lips, unbidden—a charm for the afflicted and sick, whispered only in the whispers of harsh winds and midnight tempests. Though it be considered blasphemous, though entire villages would rise to stake a witch upon the pyre for such a deed, I knew no other way. I whispered my magic into Gabrielle&rsquo;s porcelain-skinned face, willing life and vigor to her feeble body with fervor not borne from my wicked heart, but from the purity of what once was.</p><p>When I ceased my incantations, I tore my gaze away from Gabrielle&rsquo;s lingering stillness. The maiden&rsquo;s face bore a rapturous expression, tears of hope like precious jewels upon her lashes. I backed away slowly, mere feet from the necromance yet still able to feel the warmth of it no longer upon me.</p><p>And Gabrielle did live, as sunrise kissed the horizon come morning. Her cheeks regained their color, and her breathing softened into the harmonious whisper of life—an exchange of hearts; the price I would later pay in the crimson currency of despair. Hearing the hope in her heart&rsquo;s soft patter, I turned away, leaving her in the arms of her sister, who with trembling voice gave her thanks—grateful for the mercy I solicited.</p><p>For naught else had I once known. I remembered, then, the ancient tales of knights and saviors, the fevered whispers of those who despaired to succor those in need. For it was within the call for just one life that my conscience—a shackled beast—stirred once more.</p><p>But how could I remain? Hope, my old nemesis, had thus arisen, suggesting promises of love that it was destined to betray. My heart, well versed in the art of life&rsquo;s deceptions, knew that I could not flee the sorrows of my sordid past, but within me, the ember of wanton desire—doused for years under the icy cloak of malicious necessity—grown profound and unquenchable.</p><p>Despite my vile reputation, I knew not how to flee the very air that tinged my existence with the morbid crimson of deceit. The serpent that beguiles humanity&rsquo;s conscience-bound heart had ensnared me, finding solace in human love—impossible and pining like January&rsquo;s morning dew upon parched soil.</p><p>So, history repeats its cruel jest—the sun&rsquo;s waning light soon extinguished, disharmonious with a heart where love could find no refuge within time&rsquo;s cruel boundaries. And I, encumbered by the burden of my own wicked legacy, continued through life&rsquo;s shadowed vale—a blade of gray in the dusk&rsquo;s twilight, my finality unparalleled but in ever-multiplying whispers of broken trusts.</p><p>And yet, in this turbid tale, love unfolded—a balance to the wickedness which had once marred my soul. I, the villainous Scarlet Phantom, had stumbled onto a fathomless love that transcended the laughter of Valorian life. Yet, as I well knew, such sacrifices answered naught but the singer&rsquo;s scornful tune.</p><p>Upon darkened Valorian cobblestones I tread, unperturbed by life&rsquo;s fleeting essence, each step a morose waltz with destiny—my name now whispered as the Scarlet Phantom but a shadow of man&rsquo;s erstwhile love. I closed my heart to life&rsquo;s betrayal and traversed the shadows anew.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/villains-and-antagonists/>Villains and Antagonists</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/crimson-chronicles-antagonists-unveiled/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Crimson Chronicles: Antagonists Unveiled</span>
