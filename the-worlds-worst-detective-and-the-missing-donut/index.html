Griggs—often referred to by his peers as &ldquo;The World&rsquo;s Worst Detective&rdquo;—was kneeling in his office, extending a measuring tape from one end of the desk to the other. His office, a cramped, dimly-lit room tucked above a laundromat where the machines groaned and buzzed day and night, smelled faintly of mothballs. Papers were scattered across every surface, intermixed with loose change, pen caps, and a shocking collection of expired coupons. Yet, at the center of it all sat Alan, squinting with unparalleled intensity at what he considered his most perplexing case yet.</p><p>There, on his cluttered desk, was a single sheet of paper. Scrawled across the top in his nearly illegible handwriting were the haunting words: <strong>&ldquo;Case #114: The Missing Donut.&rdquo;</strong></p><p>The donut—a generously glazed specimen topped with chocolate sprinkles—had vanished three days ago. Alan had placed it on the corner of his desk as he prepared a cup of instant coffee to accompany his indulgence, only to return and discover it gone. No trace. No crumbs. Just absence.</p><p>What made matters worse was Alan&rsquo;s certainty that foul play was involved. &ldquo;A donut doesn’t just walk away,&rdquo; he muttered to himself. &ldquo;No, sir. This is the handiwork of a criminal mastermind.&rdquo;</p><p>He suspected everyone.</p><h3 id=chapter-1-suspicion-falls-on-eddie>Chapter 1: Suspicion Falls on Eddie</h3><p>Eddie, the laundromat owner and Alan&rsquo;s cantankerous downstairs neighbor, was first on the suspect list. After all, Eddie had motive—a seemingly insatiable sweet tooth—and, more importantly, opportunity. Alan knocked on the languid blue door leading to the laundromat owner&rsquo;s office. Without looking up from the massive Sudoku puzzle cradled in his hands, Eddie grumbled, &ldquo;What now, Griggs?&rdquo;</p><p>Alan, hands on hips, gave the man his most intimidating glare. Or so he thought. In reality, his furrowed brows gave him the appearance of a child trying to solve a particularly difficult math problem.</p><p>&ldquo;You know why I’m here,&rdquo; Alan declared, his voice dripping with unearned confidence.</p><p>Eddie reluctantly glanced up, squinting behind his round glasses. &ldquo;I swear, if you’re still trying to pin that donut thing on me—&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It’s not a &lsquo;donut thing!&rsquo; It’s robbery!&rdquo; Alan retorted, unfazed by Eddie’s exasperation. He paced dramatically across the laundromat, weaving between the humming machines. &ldquo;That donut was a masterpiece. The glaze? Perfect. The fluffiness of the dough? Heavenly. And now it’s gone, Eddie. Gone!&rdquo;</p><p>Eddie rolled his eyes so hard Alan swore he could hear them. &ldquo;My guy, I’ve been elbow-deep in these malfunctioning washers all week. Believe me, if I wanted a donut, I could’ve just bought one. You’re barking up the wrong tree.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Alibis mean nothing to me,&rdquo; Alan replied, trying to sound profound. In truth, he wasn’t sure what to say next. Eddie stared at him, utterly unimpressed, before returning to his Sudoku puzzle. Alan left soon after, feeling deflated but too stubborn to admit defeat.</p><h3 id=chapter-2-evidence-or-the-lack-thereof>Chapter 2: Evidence, or the Lack Thereof</h3><p>Returning to his office, Alan decided it was time to look for <em>real</em> evidence. Out came a magnifying glass roughly the size of a dinner plate and a pair of white gloves he’d borrowed from a mime performance years ago. He examined every inch of his desk with the proficiency of someone who had watched exactly one detective movie.</p><p>The results were, unsurprisingly, underwhelming. A trace of powdered sugar near the desk’s edge gave him fleeting hope, but after a meticulous taste test (which Alan later regretted), he realized it was just dust from an old envelope. Still, Alan wasn’t ready to abandon hope—not yet.</p><p>As evening descended, his patience wore thin. He pressed his fingers to his temples, racking his brain for the breakthrough he needed. &ldquo;Think, Alan. Think. Who else had access?&rdquo;</p><h3 id=chapter-3-a-new-suspect>Chapter 3: A New Suspect</h3><p>Then it hit him. Angela Pumpernickel.</p><p>Angela was the building’s part-time janitor, a regular fixture known for her fondness for cleaning supplies and overwatered ferns. She was efficient, particular, and, more importantly, she worked during the exact time slot when the donut had disappeared. Alan found her standing by the supply closet with a mop in hand and an unamused expression plastered across her face.</p><p>Angela sighed audibly as she spotted Alan approaching. &ldquo;Let me guess. You’re here about the donut.&rdquo;</p><p>Alan stopped mid-stride, clearly taken aback. &ldquo;How did you know?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You’ve been interrogating everyone in the building for two days! People talk, you know. And before you ask, no, I didn’t take your donut.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That’s precisely what a guilty party <em>would</em> say,&rdquo; Alan countered, wagging a finger at her.</p><p>Angela fixed him with a withering glare. &ldquo;Look, I don’t have time for this nonsense. I clean offices and mop floors. That’s my life. Stealing pastry doesn’t factor into my daily schedule.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Even if the pastry was exceptionally delicious?&rdquo; he asked, crossing his arms.</p><p>&ldquo;I don’t eat donuts,&rdquo; Angela snapped. &ldquo;They make my stomach hurt. Satisfied?&rdquo;</p><p>It was a pretty solid alibi, and Alan had no idea how to poke a hole in it. Still, he jotted down a note in his spiral-bound notebook: <em>Janitor not cooperating. Possible accomplice?</em></p><h3 id=chapter-4-the-breakthrough>Chapter 4: The Breakthrough</h3><p>By the third day of the investigation, Alan was running out of suspects—and, frankly, credibility. The other tenants in the building now avoided him outright, ducking into hallways or feigning phone calls whenever they saw him coming. His phone sat untouched, no new cases or even wrong numbers to keep him distracted. It was during this lull that Alan made an accidental but groundbreaking discovery.</p><p>He’d reached for an old receipt buried under a stack of expired parking tickets when he saw it. A faint chocolate smudge on the underside of a manila folder. His heart skipped a beat.</p><p>Grabbing the folder, Alan leaned in close, examining it from every angle. Could this be… evidence?</p><p>The smudge led him to a grim realization. The chocolate was suspiciously close to the fateful corner of his desk where the donut once sat. And right below that corner? His trash can.</p><p>Without pausing, Alan upended the trash can and dumped its crumpled contents onto the floor. Among paper scraps and coffee-stained napkins was the damning proof: a wrinkled wax-paper wrapper dotted with traces of chocolate and a single rogue sprinkle.</p><p>Alan’s stomach sank. Slowly, he pieced it together.</p><h3 id=chapter-5-the-culprit>Chapter 5: The Culprit</h3><p>The chocolate smudge. The wrapper in the trash. The absence of crumbs. There was only one plausible explanation for this mysterious &ldquo;theft.&rdquo; Detective Alan P. Griggs—the world&rsquo;s worst detective—had accidentally knocked his own donut into the trash can three days ago.</p><p>For a long moment, he sat there on the floor amidst piles of discarded receipts and paper scraps, staring at the incriminating evidence of his own blunder. His face flushed with a mixture of disappointment and barely-contained laughter. He had interrogated half the building over a crime that had never even occurred.</p><p>But instead of wallowing in humiliation, Alan did what only Alan could: He grabbed his notebook, flipped to the nearest blank page, and scrawled in bold letters: <strong>&ldquo;Case #115: Who Threw Away My Donut?&rdquo;</strong></p><p>And so, the world’s worst detective prepared for his next adventure, blissfully unaware of his own absurdity. After all, there was no puzzle too small or trivial for Alan P. Griggs.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/comedy-and-humor/>Comedy and Humor</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-whimsical-whimsy-delightful-delusions-of-delirium/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Whimsical Whimsy: Delightful Delusions of Delirium</span>
