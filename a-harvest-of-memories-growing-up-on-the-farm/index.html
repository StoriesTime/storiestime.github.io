My siblings and I would spend hours playing in the lush fields, our laughter mingling with the rustling of the crops in the gentle breeze. Our farm was a place where time stood still, where the rhythms of nature dictated our daily routines. Growing up on this land, surrounded by the beauty of agriculture, shaped me into the person I am today.
My earliest memories revolve around the fields. I must have been no more than three years old when I remember helping my father on the tractor, pushing aside the soggy curtains of a newly seeded cornfield. The rush of adrenaline as the machine roared to life, the smell of gasoline and freshly tilled earth, all these sensations are seared into my brain. My siblings and I would chase after the tractor, squealing with delight as the wheels of the rusty old machine sent dust and small rocks flying in all directions.
Learning the Value of Hard Work
As I grew older, my responsibilities on the farm expanded. I began by helping with the morning chores, feeding the chickens, and gathering the eggs from the coop. These small tasks taught me the value of hard work and the importance of caring for living creatures. The chickens, with their incessant clucking and scavenging, became like pets to me. I loved watching them peck at the ground, their feathers fluttering as they sought out tasty morsels.
My siblings and I worked together, starting with small tasks like mending fences and watering the crops. We learned to time our labor to avoid the scorching sun, taking breaks in the shade or under the cool canopy of a willow tree by the pond. With every new day came new lessons. We cultivated patience, understanding the importance of careful planning and precision in our farming practices.
A Game of Strategy and Accidental Harvest
Our family farm was a place of discovery, where each passage of the seasons triggered a new chapter in our never-ending adventure. The spring brought thick rains and lush new growth, the summer sun beating down relentlessly, while autumns were a riot of color, signaling the beginning of the harvest season. Amidst this ever-changing tapestry, I recall a particular episode where my siblings and I devised a game of hide and seek in the cornfield.
As I pushed aside the tall stalks, I stumbled upon an unsuspecting field mouse. Startled, I froze, worried that I'd inadvertently trapped it. In a flash of panic, I tried to gently coax it back to safety, a successful rescue that earned me a swift, triumphant grin from the tiny creature. Though never intentionally looking to herd these stray critters, my curls created a natural "coop", capturing just what my Dad would think best.
It was as if my friend, without my knowing, instinctively understood its own role. For unlike my siblings and other animals, those knew best to trust these gentle orders above.

Cultivating Traditions on the Farm
Music, an integral part of our lives, played a vital role in teaching us farm work songs. Singing hymns as we hayed the fields provided solace and purpose to our labor, teaching us about harmony within ourselves and with nature. On evenings after a long day, my Dad would wearily lead us through classic tunes, his sturdy guitar gracing our farmhouse doorway. Like threads of a rich tapestry, these melodies wove family, home, and farm together, channeling stories through generations.
