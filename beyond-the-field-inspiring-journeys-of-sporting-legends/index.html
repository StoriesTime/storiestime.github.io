Jordi Miranda, a 28-year-old professional skateboarder from Spain, embarked on an unconventional journey to the top. Growing up in Barcelona, Jordi was always fascinated by skateboarding, inspired by the likes of Tony Hawk. Despite facing rejections from local skate parks and coaches, he refused to give up.
