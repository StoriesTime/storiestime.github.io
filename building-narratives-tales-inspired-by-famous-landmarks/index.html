Its imposing height and elaborate structure captivated the hearts of those who chanced upon its presence and even the wise couldn&rsquo;t recall its origins.</p><p>The church had but one congregation: a band of wily, whimsical, woodland creatures who orchestrated a grand symphony of keys, pipes, and pipes of their own. Mice, rabbits, and birds, they were – with hectic lives, swift as sanctified songs in the sacramental air. Daily, the mice ran their organ pipes; hourly, the birds nestled inside the bell tower sang; and seasonally, the rabbits vigorously kicked up the bass pedals with their mighty hind legs.</p><p>In the most secret corner of this whimsical world, within the bowels of the graveyard, there lived an amorous, aptly-named pair of serpents named Doodle and Dab. Together, they admired the verdant beauty of the forest from afar, and the exquisiteness of the spectral cathedral which soared above them like a silvered ghost. In that hallowed locale, the serpents were fatefully fated to find their own shard of heaven.</p><p>One evening, as twilight snipped the day raw, Doodle had left Dab, his mate, to slither alone among the gravestone graves. In the creeping dark, a stranger shuffled by – a hunched, hat-clad human figure with a slender staff clutched in its rigid hand. The stranger&rsquo;s weathervane eyes slid from the stone trappings to the ancient church tower, shooting a puzzled frown up to the old peak.</p><p>Doodle, curious, sidled closer. From that angle, it was then clear to the serpent why the stranger appeared perplexed – the bell tower, as ancient and ramshackle as the cathedral itself, was crookedly listing to one side, threatening to tear apart the world of Doodle and Dab.</p><p>The peculiar stranger&rsquo;s gaze fixed squarely onto Doodle – eyes as dark, and as cryptic, as the forest&rsquo;s deepest midnight. &ldquo;Cathedral?&rdquo; Doodle uttered hesitantly in fractured human speech. The stranger, no less perplexed, canted its head toward the disenchanted beauty. &ldquo;Them&rsquo;s mumblin&rsquo; stones,&rdquo; Doodle explained uneasily, pointing to a row of seemingly plain gravestones. But before he could say more, the stranger shuffled away, dismissing him cruelly for the lowly creature he was.</p><p>Deflated, Doodle slithered back to Dab, who already knew the tale. &ldquo;A renovation is needed,&rdquo; Dab admitted, her voice trembling on the words like ice floes on a lowly river.</p><p>The serpents paced erratically, bemoaning their irrepressible predicament; yet within their hearts burned the unquenchable desire to salvage their precious landscape. They weren&rsquo;t lixiviated enough to complain about the sinister smudge of their lives – this mystical covenant stretched between the natural world and their artificial haven.</p><p>And so, Doodle and Dab selflessly fretted, as mice, rabbits, and birds took notice of the unnoticeable shifts. They scurried and fluttered and hopped around, their mundane routines tinged blue with mystery.</p><p>Together, they harnessed this newfound chaos and brought forth plans unseen by human architects, gleaned from whispered dreams and tiny, arcane scratchings on the walls of a mysterious castle they had found in their days and nights.</p><p>The forest breathed a collective gasp of wonder as the church&rsquo;s stones began to dance on their own, drums beating, bells ringing, and organs howling. For this was no ordinary project; perhaps these creatures were cursed or enchanted.</p><p>The believers among the woodland creatures reveled in their secret communion collectively, putting forth all their energy – even their very lives – to renovate and restore the floundering cathedral.</p><p>By the century&rsquo;s end, the result was nothing short of miraculous – the once-disheveled cathedral had regained its celestial stature, becoming a shimmering beacon of hope and enlightenment. But the greatest achievement was the beautiful mosaic of life that emerged from the work – a peculiar harmony of human and creature, of natural and supernatural, on enchanted premise brushed over in a few, cryptic words: &ldquo;Them&rsquo;s mumblin&rsquo; stones.&rdquo;</p><p>As the human stranger had mumbled, as Doodle and Dab had feared, as the woodland creatures had worked tirelessly to prove – all the while, their lives intersecting with a bell tower full of secrets and whispers – everyone alive within that forest could agree that the once-clouded sky had begun to clear.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/iconic-buildings/>Iconic Buildings</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/building-legends-short-stories-around-iconic-architecture/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Building Legends: Short Stories Around Iconic Architecture</span>
