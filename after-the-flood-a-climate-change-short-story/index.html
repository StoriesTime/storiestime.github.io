For three mornings in a row, as the sun wrung itself out from the brown horizon, she climbed what was left of the corroded pedestrian flyover in Qen’s End and listened. The story went that if you stood very still, long before the fog and the heat staked their joint claim, you’d catch the world’s new choir. But when Umair teased her—“What did they sing today, Rinat? The same broken song?”—she rolled her eyes, as if his skepticism was the dullest thing about the drowned world.</p><p>Below, the city that used to be Qen’s End rusted quietly. Boats nudged the remains of lamp posts. Metre-thick tangles of kelp, blown in from oceans that should have been far away, painted the upper windows of half-submerged apartment towers. In what was once called Uptown, a school bus, algae-choked but still upright, jutted out of green water like a capsized tooth.</p><p>“It’s not a song,” Rinat finally said, sitting cross-legged on the flyover’s highest beam. “It’s warnings. To each other, maybe. Or to us. Maybe both.”</p><p>Unair pointed his boot down to the water swirling three stories under their perch. A mechanical fish, armored in chipped blue plastic, nudged plastiglomerate detritus; someone had set it adrift ages ago to scare off looters, but now it floated without purpose, its battery eaten hollow by salt.</p><p>“Then sing it for me, Rinat,” he said. “If you understand.”</p><p>She closed her eyes, smiled crookedly, and refused.</p><hr><p>Thirty years before, this place drowned over a single season. It started slow. Spring tides nibbled away at the riverfront parks. Unseasonable frosts crippled crops, followed by rains that arrived weeks too late and then didn’t stop. Rivers refused to leave, growing hungry; the sea, bored with its old boundaries, swept into them, carving new cities out of the notion of land.</p><p>By the time midsummer arrived, the waves and wind had co-authored a new coastline. State emergency departments hadn’t anticipated that, after centuries of cartographic certainty, such a boundary could break so easily. The dominoes fell—transport, power, comms, food. The lucky or connected fled to higher ground. The rest stayed, becoming statistics or survivors or, eventually, myths.</p><p>Now, years later, some called Qen’s End a “liminal city.” The lucky called somewhere else home. The rest drifted through the ruins, binding what they could into new ways of living: mariners, divers, scavengers, wetland farmers.</p><hr><p>The air at dawn tasted of battery acid, but when Rinat pressed her hand to the flaked iron of the railing, she could feel the city’s heartbeat, faint but patient.</p><p>She remembered her mother’s stories from the old neighborhood—tales of air so thick with bougainvillea scent it could lull you to sleep, of a skeletal dog that used to trail the schoolchildren, of a market selling fried fish and cloud-soft bread every Friday. Now even the stray dogs had moved on, replaced by salt-hardened herons.</p><p>At low tide, she sometimes helped Umair sort through the debris lines on what had been Dalan Street. The city’s natives said the tide pooled objects from every era: a lockless bike with a “Class of 2036” sticker, kitchen tiles stamped with burned-in roses, moldy textbooks swollen to twice their thickness. It was a museum, but without placards or protection.</p><p>One morning, Rinat waded chest-deep to rummage through the washed-up remnants under Tower H. The water was cold with a metallic edge. Flipping over a drift of tangled electrical cables, she found a plastic bin full of ID cards from before the flood. Faces smudged into anonymity, barcodes bloomed with black fungus. She showed one to Umair, whose jaw tightened.</p><p>“We’re ghosts here,” he said.</p><p>Rinat shrugged and pocketed a card that looked vaguely like her elder brother.</p><p>Some afternoons, when the humidity pressed even harder and the generator failed, Rinat would wander up the flyover alone. She watched the fish. Silver flashers clustered in the shallows, picking through the wreckage of the sunken city. Not so long ago, each of those fish would have been an invasive species, a biologist’s headache. Now they thrived, and Rinat fancied they might remember the outlines of traffic lanes, the echo of streetlights reflected from car windows. Her mind swam with impossible ideas: perhaps the fish were collecting memories, not just warnings.</p><p>When Umair’s patience allowed, she told him so.</p><p>“They’re only seeking food,” he’d say, fussing with the water collector’s filter. “They only remember the taste of survival.”</p><hr><p>In the hold of their patchwork boat—a guzzling vessel stitched together from catamaran pontoons, solar panels, and a dozen kinds of plastic waste—they made what passed for home. Rinat’s favorite spot was in the bow, where a battered wool blanket covered an upturned crate that squeaked if you shifted too suddenly.</p><p>Their crew wasn’t large: Rinat, Umair, and Lea, plus Umair’s yellow cat, Musk, who had learned to ride tides with feline disdain. Sometimes, when the marshland tribes sent traders into the flooded grid, a fourth would join briefly, but never for long. Qen’s End had a way of keeping its promises of isolation.</p><p>People always asked why they stayed. Rinat’s answer was simple: the city was made of memories. Even now, with earth and water braided visibly in every direction, it was impossible, for her at least, to declare loss total. Survival here required stubbornness, yes, but also a certain faith, or foolishness, that whispered, <em>maybe the water gives as much as it takes</em>.</p><p>On rainless nights, the crew fished—real fishing, with silence and patience. They’d string a thin wire off the port side, baited with worms cut from a compost pail salvaged from a tenth-floor balcony garden. Occasionally, a fish would bite. Rinat would draw it up, examine it with gentle mock-seriousness, whisper a secret, and drop it back.</p><p>Lea asked once what the point was.</p><p>“Conversation,” Rinat replied. “And practice for hunger.”</p><hr><p>As spring pressed into summer, the fog tried a new kind of menace. Morning visibility shrank to a matter of steps. The city, already a puzzle of half-remembered geography, rearranged itself by the hour. Even Umair’s memory for landmarks wavered. Rusted out air-conditioning units that marked street corners vanished. Rooftop gardens, set glowing by bioluminescent mold, drifted through puddles of light and dark.</p><p>That’s when the <em>real</em> stories began. Neighbors swore that shadows moved under the water, patterns traced in the mud by something greater than storms or scavengers. Old marble steps, uncovered by a falling tide, were found the next week buried deep under a drift of river sand, as if the city itself tried to rewrite its past.</p><p>Rinat watched the changes with fascination. She saw more fish than before, bigger ones, including a golden carp that, Lea insisted, was the reanimated spirit of Qen’s End’s last mayor. She started keeping a log—half sketches, half flurries of speculation—of animals she spotted cruising through the flooded markets and tangled subway passages.</p><p>Once, close to dusk, she watched a trio of river otters wrestle a plastic traffic cone onto a muddy median, transforming it into a slide. She laughed harder than she had in months.</p><p>She began quietly to believe in transformation as much as loss.</p><hr><p>The city’s politics, like its boundaries, were liquid now. A dozen little communities clung to the highest towers and rooftops, some welcoming and others fiercely private.</p><p>The East Bridge Collective struck a bargain with Rinat and her friends: two jerry cans of biofuel if they could ferry food packets past the half-collapsed highway ramp where East Bridge’s sentinels slept. The South Dockers traded scavenge-rights for water-filtration tips. Rule was enforced by reputation and negotiation, not by statute.</p><p>A month after the fog changed, a rumor drifted upriver. Qen’s End would soon be “cleaned”—a fleet of drones, sponsored by the northern corporations, would descend and begin collecting, deconstructing, removing. No one was certain what that meant: resettlement, demolition, eradication. The rumor arrived on the wind and with it, anxiety.</p><p>At a meeting on what used to be Folly Hill Drive, surrounded by darkness and oil-drum firelight, arguments broke out. Some wanted to evacuate before the fleet arrived, even if that meant leaving every scrap of survival behind. Others argued it was a lie—a trick by upstream interests to empty the city for a new kind of colonization.</p><p>Rinat said little. She listened, fingers tracing an outline of the city on a mold-stained slab of plywood. When it was finally time to speak, she offered a suggestion: stay alert, stay mobile, and listen for rumors from the water as well as from the air.</p><p>After the meeting, Umair joined her near the waterline. “You think they’ll come?”</p><p>“They might,” she replied. “But the city still hides more than maps can show.”</p><hr><p>A week later, a roaring woke them at dawn.</p><p>Drones, yes. Not in a fleet, but in a slow whirring arc—small ones with fins for aquatic mobility, trailing sensor pods and trailing bright flags with corporate logos. The city’s birds scattered at their passage. Fishermen crowded rooftops and stare-bases, watching with wary eyes.</p><p>The drones weren’t hunting people, at least not directly. Their cameras scanned, mapped, sent data back to some server past the horizon. An announcement, pre-recorded, played in a half-dozen major languages on public frequencies: <em>“To all residents: prepare for transition. Resources will be provided for evacuation. Permanent reclamation to follow. Volunteers will be processed for intake in highland settlements.”</em></p><p>Rinat stood on her favorite perch, listening.</p><p>“It’s polite,” she noted. “The warning, I mean. Almost tender.”</p><p>“They’re here to make our leaving seem like a choice,” Umair said.</p><p>“Or to see what we will do—if we’ll vanish without protest, become footnotes.”</p><p>For days, the tension rose like humidity. Some people left, gathering what little they had and climbing into corporate rafts that accompanied the drones. But just as many refused. They barricaded passageways, sent misleading radio pings, rearranged boat paths to confuse the maps. Stories spread of a new crop of animals making homes among the ruins — dolphins in the deepest canals, pelicans nesting on marble balustrades.</p><p>And in those days, Rinat truly heard the fish.</p><p>It wasn’t song, not really—more like a weaving chain of interruptions, a series of splashes and movements synchronized just beyond human grasp. She sat motionless, morning and dusk, watching the waters; the city’s old rhythms, she realized, were being overwritten by the world’s oldest. The tide marked time now, not buses or markets.</p><p>She wondered if survival was always about remembering, but not in the way people insisted. <em>Maybe</em>, she mused, <em>forgetting is part of it too.</em></p><p>She took her journal and sketched what she saw: a new city, born in the intertidal.</p><hr><p>By summer&rsquo;s height, the situation settled into a tense waiting game. Those who chose to stay did so deliberately. They built new kinds of markets from floating pallets, dredged rooftop cisterns for water, cultivated patient mutual aid networks. Making do was an art form: repairs with garden-wire and melted sandals, solar cookers cobbled from window glass and metal trays.</p><p>Sometimes drones still appeared: to map, to threaten, to encourage. Each time, the response was the same—a sullen, communal silence, punctuated by the urgent, joyful noise of living.</p><p>Rinat and her friends taught others how to find edible moss, how to coax tomatoes from damp rooftop grow-bags, how to filter water with char and gravel. The lessons weren’t new—every generation of survivors always found the wisdom that had been dismissed as obsolete.</p><p>One evening, after the sun had dropped behind a row of skeletal towers, Umair handed Rinat a battered, silt-smudged radio. “Found it near the old library,” he said. “Maybe it still works.”</p><p>She took it, unscrewed the back, and cleaned the connections with a bit of lemon and wire. When it finally crackled to life, they tuned through frequencies, picking up the static-drowned signals from other flooded cities. Each one, a chorus of struggle and adaptation, each clinging to its own peculiar hope.</p><p>Listening, Rinat wrote:</p><blockquote><p><em>We are built to live in change. Each city sings its own melody, and ours is made of water, metal, fish, and patience. If tomorrow brings eviction, we will go, but we will bring this song with us. If we stay, we rebuild anew, as all tides eventually do.</em></p></blockquote><hr><p>When the autumn rains finally arrived, they did so with the gentleness of a long-needed apology. Fresh water fell, replenishing cisterns and coaxing stubborn seeds from cracks and roof gutters. The city, so long a place of endings, found a new rhythm in beginnings.</p><p>On her morning climb to the flyover, Rinat paused. Below, the water glimmered with the sun’s gold; fish darted between columns. She looked up, certain that if she listened closely, she might hear not a warning, but an invitation—an endless, unfinished song, swelling and receding with the tide.</p><p>The flood had taken much—land, certainty, even beloved faces—but it had also given this: a place where life would not be dictated by the old borders. Where every day opened with the question, <em>How will you build the world now?</em></p><p>Rinat tucked a fish scale inside her journal and, for the first time since the waters came, sang back.</p><hr><p>Fin.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/climate-change/>Climate Change</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/adapt-or-perish-short-stories-on-climate-change-survival/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Adapt or Perish: Short Stories on Climate Change Survival</span>
