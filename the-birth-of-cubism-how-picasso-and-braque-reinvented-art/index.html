This was in France, during the summer of 1907, at Montmartre&rsquo;s famous Bateau-Lavoir cabaret, where artists congregated to share ideas, a place where the foundations of cubism were about to be laid.</p><p>Picasso&rsquo;s first cubist painting, &ldquo;Les Demoiselles d&rsquo;Avignon,&rdquo; generated mixed reviews but captivated Braque who was struck by its innovative design and fresh perspective. The flat, almost mosaic-like treatment of its subjects coupled with the fabrication of space was profound, a fresh artistic perspective. The seed for their joint venture had been sown.</p><p>Braque, initially just Picasso&rsquo;s friend and fellow artist, whose expertise in furniture design later emphasized the power in Cubism&rsquo;s geometric simplicity, was soon greatly influenced by Picasso&rsquo;s new approach. Their friendship turned into a professional connexion destined to revolutionize the world of modern art. They started work on a series of paintings collaboratively.</p><p>One day, Picasso suggested that Braque join him in a painting project that would later be known as &ldquo;Les Aubes,&rdquo; which marked the official inception of the artistic duo&rsquo;s journey into the realm of cubism. Like the strokes of a symphony where each musician creates harmony, so did these two experts utilize their respective abilities to create art that was nothing short of a revelation.</p><p>Braque&rsquo;s slice from the painting was a reflection of the one painted by Picasso, only turned at an angle to provoke a different perspective. Thus, began the birth of a new art form. This critical first step eventually led to them using identical canvases, with one artist painting all sides. This style created a type of optical printer mechanism that embedded an entirely nuanced third perspective that would only surface as the viewer allowed themselves to be enshrouded by the art.</p><p>The birth of cubism rapidly gained strength, such that by 1909, their work had taken a further leap, transitioning into an analytical form. The subjects in their paintings seemed almost geometric like a kaleidoscope, sometimes with several angles at once or fragmented, creating a revolutionary interaction between picture and spectator.</p><p>This new approach wasn&rsquo;t easy to comprehend, but it wasn&rsquo;t just academics or critics who were drawn in. Art enthusiasts from different corners found solace in this new world where they could explore forms they could not in reality. Everything they experienced became thought-provoking, challenging their belief system, and enlivening their curiosity.</p><p>The ingrained tradition and legacy of Picasso&rsquo;s and Braque&rsquo;s masterpieces nurtured a whole new approach to artistic creation and interpretation. The way an artist conceived and put form on canvas shifted from a prettier imitation of life to an intellectual visualization of reality, delivering the viewer a mental, cerebral voyage.</p><p>Their embrace of multiple viewpoints led them to break the constraints of traditional perspectives, revolutionizing the art world. They headed down uncharted paths, seeking unseen possibilities, imagined without equations, explored without the spectacles of illusions, and discovered without the limitations of lenses.</p><p>In the end, the genius of the cubism movement took over, outgrowing the duet&rsquo;s personal efforts. Intensely criticized yet quietly respected, Picasso and Braque laid down the foundations for a whole new world of avant-garde art that drew from a palette of culture, philosophy, math, and science.</p><p>Picasso once said, &ldquo;Every child is an artist. The problem is how to remain an artist once he grows up.&rdquo; This story about the birth of cubism is testimony to his vision. For Picasso and Braque, growing up was not about stifling their imaginations but amplifying it, unshackling art from its formulas, and setting it free to redefine what abstraction, figure, and space could be. Through this, cubism was born, and with it, ushered an era of unbridled imaginative exploration that continues to impact the world of art today.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/artistic-movements/>Artistic Movements</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-birth-of-cubism-a-tale-of-bold-experimentation/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Birth of Cubism: A Tale of Bold Experimentation</span>
