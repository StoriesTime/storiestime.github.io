These places don&rsquo;t often make it to the maps, not because they aren&rsquo;t known, but because they are the type of places no one truly wants to speak of. There is an old house, hidden among the ever-encroaching forest, where many claim to have seen the shadow in the corner. The house has been abandoned for years, yet the stories persist.</p><p>And I should know because I’ve seen it myself.</p><p>I never thought I’d be the type to believe in ghosts or spirits. Growing up, I was the skeptic, the one who rolled my eyes at ghost stories and chuckled at tales of haunted places. But that was before I went to the house. The house with the shadow in the corner.</p><h3 id=the-invitation>The Invitation</h3><p>I first heard about it from my friend, Ben, a passionate paranormal enthusiast. He had heard the rumors—whispers of strange happenings in an old, decaying house in the woods just outside our town. At first, I thought it was just another one of his wild ideas, the kind of thing he&rsquo;d get excited about after binge-watching a late-night documentary about haunted houses. But something in his eyes when he spoke of it made me pause.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something different about this place, Mark,&rdquo; he said one night over a beer. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just another abandoned house. It’s alive. The house, I mean. And it’s not just a place. It’s something&mldr; dark.&rdquo;</p><p>I was intrigued, despite myself. Part of me wanted to dismiss it, to tell Ben to go back to investigating ghostly sightings on his own. But the more he described the house, the more the mystery drew me in. It was built over a century ago, tucked away in the woods on the outskirts of town. The locals had always avoided it. They spoke in hushed tones of strange lights flickering in the windows at night and the eerie, almost palpable feeling of being watched when you neared the property. Of course, most of it could have been chalked up to superstition, but there was something in the way people avoided the house that seemed too real to ignore.</p><p>&ldquo;You want to go?&rdquo; Ben asked one evening, leaning forward with that gleam of excitement in his eyes that always made me wary.</p><p>I took a long sip of my beer and tried to ignore the small shiver running down my spine. &ldquo;Sure. Why not?&rdquo;</p><h3 id=the-journey>The Journey</h3><p>The drive to the house was longer than I expected. We wound our way through narrow, twisting roads, the kind that barely fit two cars side by side, and the trees began to close in around us. The further we went, the more the air seemed to grow still. The chirping of crickets and the rustling of leaves seemed to die out, replaced by an unsettling quiet that clung to everything. I could feel it creeping under my skin, the weight of something unseen and unknown.</p><p>Finally, after what felt like hours, we reached it. The house stood before us, a dilapidated shell of what it once was. Its tall, dark windows seemed to leer at us, and the faint outline of the front door swayed in the wind as if beckoning us inside.</p><p>I took a deep breath and stepped out of the car. The house looked like it had been forgotten by time itself. The paint was peeling, and the roof had long since caved in at certain spots. Vines crawled up the sides, and the air smelled of mildew and decay. Despite its run-down appearance, there was a strange energy to it. Something pulsed from within the walls, something that made the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure about this?&rdquo; I asked Ben, my voice suddenly uncertain.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he replied, already halfway up the creaky stairs to the front door. &ldquo;This is it, Mark. This is where everything changes.&rdquo;</p><p>I hesitated, but the curiosity was too strong. I followed him inside.</p><h3 id=inside-the-house>Inside the House</h3><p>The interior was no less eerie. The floorboards groaned under our weight, and the walls seemed to close in as we moved deeper into the house. Dust hung thick in the air, and cobwebs draped every corner like remnants of forgotten memories. The house was silent, except for the occasional creak of wood and the whisper of the wind outside. But beneath that, there was something more. A feeling. A presence. It lingered, like a shadow just beyond the corner of your eye.</p><p>Ben led the way through the house, his flashlight illuminating strange symbols carved into the walls and floors. &ldquo;People say these markings are part of a ritual,&rdquo; he explained, his voice barely a whisper. &ldquo;A way to trap something here. Something dark.&rdquo;</p><p>I wasn&rsquo;t sure what he meant by &ldquo;something dark,&rdquo; but the more I looked around, the more I began to feel an oppressive weight pressing down on me. The house felt alive in a way that was impossible to ignore. There was no place where the feeling of being watched wasn’t present.</p><p>We reached the back of the house, where a large room awaited us. It was empty, save for the remnants of old furniture scattered about. A heavy curtain hung over the far wall, and I could see faint light seeping through the cracks. Something about it made my heart race.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the room,&rdquo; Ben said, pointing toward the curtain. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where it all happens. The shadow in the corner.&rdquo;</p><p>The words sent a chill down my spine.</p><h3 id=the-shadow-in-the-corner>The Shadow in the Corner</h3><p>Ben pulled the curtain aside, and we stepped into the room. It was colder here, and the air was thick, like it was holding its breath. My eyes scanned the room, taking in the faded wallpaper, the remnants of broken furniture, and the dim light filtering in from the cracks in the walls.</p><p>And then I saw it.</p><p>At first, it was just a flicker in the corner of the room, like a shadow cast by the uneven light. But then it became clearer—darker, thicker than anything the light could create. A shape. A form. It moved, just slightly, as if aware of our presence.</p><p>I froze.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you see it?&rdquo; Ben asked, his voice barely audible.</p><p>I nodded, unable to speak. The shadow in the corner shifted, a long, dark figure that seemed to stretch and bend unnaturally, as though it were not bound by the same laws of physics that governed the rest of the world. It was almost as if it was alive, an entity that had no right to exist in the space it occupied.</p><p>And then it spoke. Not with words, but with a presence. A voice that I could feel deep in my chest, vibrating like a pulse.</p><p>Leave.</p><p>It wasn’t just a suggestion—it was a command, a force that pressed against my mind, pushing me toward the door, urging me to run.</p><p>But I didn’t move. I couldn’t.</p><p>Ben seemed to snap out of his trance first. &ldquo;We have to go,&rdquo; he said urgently. &ldquo;Now.&rdquo;</p><p>But it was too late.</p><p>The shadow in the corner grew, stretching toward us, pulling the darkness around it. I could hear the sound of something breathing—slow, deliberate, like a predator toying with its prey. The room seemed to shrink, the walls closing in around us.</p><p>Ben reached for the door, but it slammed shut with a force that sent a shockwave through the house. We were trapped.</p><p>The shadow in the corner shifted again, and this time, it took form. A face appeared in the darkness—eyes without pupils, hollow and endless. It grinned, its teeth sharp and jagged, stretching across its face like a grotesque mask.</p><p>&ldquo;Leave this place,&rdquo; it whispered, and I could feel its words in my bones. &ldquo;Or stay and be consumed.&rdquo;</p><p>I couldn’t move, couldn’t think. My mind was frozen in terror.</p><p>Ben, in a blind panic, pulled at the door again, and this time, it opened. We stumbled out into the hallway, gasping for air as if we’d been submerged underwater. The shadow was still there, lingering in the corner of my vision, but we didn’t stop. We ran.</p><h3 id=the-escape>The Escape</h3><p>We didn’t look back as we sprinted through the house, out the front door, and into the forest. The woods felt like a safe haven compared to what we had left behind. When we reached the car, I slammed the door shut, and Ben floored the gas pedal.</p><p>We didn’t speak for a long time.</p><p>As we drove away, I couldn’t shake the feeling that the shadow had followed us, that it was still watching, waiting for the next moment it could step out of the corner and into our lives again.</p><p>We never spoke of the house again.</p><p>But sometimes, in the quiet of the night, when the house is just a shadow in my memory, I still feel it. The weight of those eyes. The whisper of that voice.</p><p>And I know—somewhere out there, in the corner of the world, the shadow is waiting.</p><hr><p><strong>End.</strong></p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/ghost-stories/>Ghost Stories</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-shadow-in-the-attic/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Shadow in the Attic</span>
