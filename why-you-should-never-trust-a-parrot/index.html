He had just returned from a long day at the office and was walking through his neighborhood when something caught his eye in an antique shop window. Perched on a wooden stand, with vibrant green feathers and a sharp beak, the parrot seemed almost otherworldly.</p><p>The shop was called “Curiosities and Oddities,” and the owner, a thin, elderly woman named Mrs. Penn, noticed Henry&rsquo;s gaze before he even stepped inside. “Ah, you have an eye for the unusual,” she remarked, with a smile that seemed to stretch too far across her face. “That bird, you know, has quite the reputation.”</p><p>Henry raised an eyebrow. He wasn’t in the market for a pet, let alone an exotic bird, but something about the parrot intrigued him. “What’s its story?”</p><p>Mrs. Penn’s expression darkened slightly. “It’s an old one. Don’t let the beauty fool you. Birds like that… they have secrets.”</p><p>Unfazed, Henry shrugged and stepped inside. The parrot’s eyes locked onto him as he approached, its gaze sharp and intelligent, almost like it was sizing him up.</p><p>“Go ahead,” Mrs. Penn encouraged. “Say something to it.”</p><p>Henry chuckled, unsure of what to expect. “Hello, bird.”</p><p>The parrot tilted its head. “Hello, bird,” it replied in a perfect imitation of Henry’s voice.</p><p>He froze. The bird’s voice was almost too precise, too human.</p><p>“You see?” Mrs. Penn said, her eyes glinting with something that could have been mischief. “It picks up everything. A very clever one.”</p><p>Henry, amused but also a little unnerved, gave the bird one last glance. “I’ll pass. Thanks, but no thanks.”</p><p>But as he turned to leave, the parrot squawked loudly. “You’ll regret it!”</p><p>Henry stopped in his tracks, his heart skipping a beat. He turned back slowly. “What did you say?”</p><p>The parrot was silent, its beak closed tight. Mrs. Penn was watching him carefully.</p><p>“It doesn’t usually speak like that,” she said softly. “Perhaps you should reconsider.”</p><p>But Henry was too skeptical. “It’s just a bird, nothing more,” he muttered, and walked out the door, ignoring the pang of doubt creeping up his spine.</p><hr><p>Weeks passed, and life returned to normal. Henry couldn’t shake the strange words the parrot had spoken, but he quickly dismissed them as the result of his imagination. Birds didn’t speak with foresight, after all.</p><p>Then one evening, as he was making his way home after another exhausting day at work, a peculiar feeling swept over him. The street felt quieter than usual. A heavy fog had begun to roll in, shrouding the area in an eerie silence.</p><p>As he approached his apartment building, he caught a glimpse of a familiar face—the elderly Mrs. Penn, standing in the street. She seemed agitated, looking over her shoulder nervously. Henry walked up to her.</p><p>“Mrs. Penn, is everything alright?”</p><p>She jumped slightly, as though startled by his presence. “You need to go back, Henry,” she said urgently. “I’ve made a mistake. You shouldn’t have left that bird behind. You have to go back to the shop before it’s too late.”</p><p>Henry frowned. “What are you talking about? The parrot is just a bird.”</p><p>Mrs. Penn grabbed his arm, her hands trembling. “I’m telling you, it’s more than that. You don’t understand—”</p><p>A loud squawk echoed from down the street. Henry turned sharply. There, perched on a lamppost, was the parrot. Its sharp eyes were locked onto him once more.</p><p>“You should have listened,” the bird said, in Henry’s own voice.</p><p>A chill ran down Henry’s spine, but Mrs. Penn’s grip tightened. “You have to go back. The bird— it’s not just a bird. It’s been watching you, listening. It knows things.”</p><p>“I’m not going back to that shop,” Henry said, his voice shaking, though he wasn’t sure if it was from fear or disbelief.</p><p>Mrs. Penn looked at him, her face pale and haggard. “It has control over you now. It knows your fears, your desires. It manipulates, it deceives. What you think is a harmless pet is an agent of something much darker. I should have warned you earlier, but I didn’t think—”</p><p>Henry’s thoughts raced. The parrot’s eerie words rang in his mind. “You’ll regret it.” Could it be possible that a bird had this much power?</p><p>Before he could say anything more, Mrs. Penn pulled him by the sleeve and started dragging him down the foggy street. “You have to trust me. We can stop it. But only if you act now.”</p><p>They arrived at the shop in a few minutes. The door creaked open, and a cold breeze swept through the room. The parrot was still perched in the same spot, its unblinking eyes following their every movement.</p><p>“I knew you’d come back,” the bird said, its voice low and ominous. “Now it’s too late.”</p><p>Henry stepped forward, feeling an almost magnetic pull toward the bird. Mrs. Penn, however, held him back.</p><p>“Don’t let it speak to you,” she warned. “It’s already begun.”</p><p>But Henry was fixated. “What is this? What are you trying to tell me?”</p><p>The parrot tilted its head and blinked slowly. “I’ve been watching you, Henry. I know everything. You’ll never escape.”</p><p>Suddenly, the lights in the shop flickered. Henry felt a strange dizziness, as though the air itself was thickening around him. His mind started to swirl with thoughts, memories, and fragments of fears—things he’d buried long ago. The parrot&rsquo;s voice echoed through his head, louder and louder, until it felt like his very thoughts were no longer his own.</p><p>Mrs. Penn shouted something, but it was drowned out by the parrot&rsquo;s insistent squawking. “You’ll never escape. You’ll never escape. Never escape…”</p><p>With a final, desperate push, Henry tried to break free from the shop, but his legs wouldn’t move. The room seemed to stretch, and his vision blurred. He realized too late that the parrot wasn’t just manipulating his thoughts—it was controlling him.</p><p>Mrs. Penn stood in the doorway, her hands trembling. “You have to break the curse, Henry! The bird is not just a creature of flesh. It’s an agent of the darkness that preys on the weak of mind.”</p><p>The parrot’s voice filled his ears one last time. “You belong to me now, Henry.”</p><p>Suddenly, the fog outside seemed to part, and a burst of light filled the room. Henry’s mind cleared for a brief moment, and in that instant, he understood. The bird wasn’t simply a parrot—it was a creature bound to ancient magic, capable of manipulating those who interacted with it. It fed on their fears, their secrets, and their weaknesses. Those who trusted it were forever its prey.</p><p>With a final surge of willpower, Henry managed to break free, stumbling out of the shop and into the now-clear street. The parrot’s voice faded into the distance, leaving nothing but silence.</p><hr><p>Weeks passed, and Henry never returned to the shop. He tried to forget the terrifying experience, but the memory lingered. He began to notice something strange, though—he had started to see parrots everywhere. On TV, in the park, in people’s homes. They were always watching, always waiting.</p><p>The paranoia began to eat at him. What if the bird was still following him? What if it hadn’t let go? The thought gnawed at him, until one day, as he was walking home from work, he heard a familiar squawk from above.</p><p>Looking up, he saw a parrot perched on a nearby building. Its eyes locked onto his, and it spoke in a voice that sent shivers down his spine: “You’ll never escape.”</p><p>In that moment, Henry understood.</p><p>You should never trust a parrot.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/comedy-and-humor/>Comedy and Humor</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/why-i-should-never-try-cooking/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Why I Should Never Try Cooking</span>
