With grit and perseverance, she trained tirelessly, pushing herself beyond her limits. She sought guidance from experienced coaches and absorbed every piece of advice like a sponge. Despite the naysayers, Maya remained focused on her goal: to break barriers and prove that gender was no obstacle to success in sports.</p><p>As Maya&rsquo;s skills sharpened and her confidence grew, she began to enter local competitions.
