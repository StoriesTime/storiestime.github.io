The sun pierced the bedroom blinds, scattering narrow stripes of light across the carpet. Andrea groaned as her alarm buzzed, its shrill tone cutting through the fragmented quiet of early morning. She reached out with a sleepy hand, fumbling to silence the intrusive sound. Another day, another commute, another meeting-filled slog at the office. It was routine, predictable, and—if she were honest—a little boring. But Andrea didn’t question it. Boring, after all, was comfortable.</p><p>As she brewed her coffee, the news murmured from the TV in the corner. She half-listened, stirring cream into her mug absentmindedly. Something about the virus overseas. It had been background noise for weeks now, sporadically breaking into conversations at work or over dinner. Word was that Italy was shutting down, and China had been on lockdown for months—factoids that darted across her periphery but felt confined to somewhere distant, somewhere removed. Andrea wondered about all the hype. Sure, it sounded bad, but it wasn’t here. Not really.</p><p>By 7:30 a.m., she was easing her car into traffic, the growing congestion weaving its chaotic patterns across the road. Talk radio accompanied her drive: more mentions of the virus, speculative chatter about the economic impact, brief bursts of humor from the hosts trying to lighten the mood. Andrea didn’t think too much of it; she had her own priorities—an 8:30 a.m. client meeting and lunch plans with her friend Clara.</p><p>At the office, the buzz of normalcy filled the air. Phones ringing, keyboards clicking, colleagues greeting one another in passing, just like they always did. Andrea settled into her desk, scrolling through emails before her meeting. Then came the first oddity of the day. Sarah, the receptionist, walked through the main hallway clutching a large bottle of hand sanitizer. It wasn’t her usual friendly banter that marked her arrival; instead, she stopped at every desk, offering squirts of the gel. “Apparently, we’re supposed to start doing this,” she explained, a sheepish smile creeping across her face.</p><p>Andrea laughed nervously and held out her hands. “Thanks, I guess?” She rubbed the sharp-smelling liquid between her palms, involuntarily glancing around. Several colleagues exchanged uneasy looks—half confusion, half amusement—but no one said much.</p><p>The meeting went on as scheduled, albeit with a subtle change in atmosphere. The client was polite, attentive, but noticeably reserved. He refrained from shaking hands, even as Andrea instinctively extended hers. “Sorry,” he said with a grimace, stuffing his hands into his pockets. “Better safe than sorry, you know?”</p><p>Andrea nodded, though internally, she rolled her eyes. Paranoia had a way of spreading faster than facts. For now, though, everything still felt manageable. The virus was still elsewhere.</p><p>At noon, Andrea met Clara at their usual deli, the one right on the corner of Fifth and Maple. The comforting hum of conversations and sizzling grills greeted her as she walked through the door. Clara was already seated, scrolling through her phone. When Andrea sat down, she didn’t need to ask what was occupying her friend’s attention.</p><p>“Have you seen the news?” Clara leaned across the table, her voice low as she showed Andrea her screen. Articles flashed across the display, headlines dominated by words like “outbreak,” “confirmed cases,” and “containment zones.”</p><p>Andrea shrugged. “Yeah, it sounds bad, but we’ll be fine. Things always settle down after a while, don’t they?”</p><p>Clara frowned and set her phone aside. “I don’t know. Italy’s still on lockdown, and there’s talk that it might be heading here sooner than we think. I read something about this thing being airborne. If that’s true…”</p><p>“Clara, you sound like one of those doomsday preppers.” Andrea tried to laugh it off, picking at her salad. But there was a heaviness in Clara’s tone that lingered even after the conversation shifted.</p><p>By mid-afternoon, Andrea’s office was abuzz with whispers. Sara from operations mentioned her children’s school had sent vague emails about “transitional learning plans.” Tim from IT said his sister’s office downtown abruptly closed after someone tested positive for “that thing.” Andrea kept working, though her focus wavered, pulled apart by snippets of the growing tension.</p><p>Things escalated around 4 p.m. when their manager entered the room. His face was grave, betraying concern he clearly didn’t want to unload onto his team. “Everyone,” he said, standing stiffly near the middle of the room, “I’ve just received word from corporate. Starting tomorrow, we’ll all be transitioning to remote operations, at least for a week or two.”</p><p>The shockwaves were immediate. Questions flew from every desk—what did this mean? Was the business in trouble? Were they overreacting? The manager dodged specifics, offering canned reassurances that this was “precautionary” and “temporary.” Andrea’s stomach twisted at his uncertainty.</p><p>She left work that evening in a fog, the usual stream of traffic feeling oddly sterile. Clara texted her several links to articles, all worse than the last. She ignored them for now. Surely, this was overblown, just another exaggerated hiccup in daily life.</p><p>Andrea scarcely noticed as she unlocked her apartment door and dropped her bag by the couch. Habit moved her limbs through the motions—heat up leftovers, pour herself a glass of wine, flick the TV over to her favorite sitcom. But the laughter on screen felt hollow this time, as though it came from somewhere years away.</p><p>It wasn’t until 9 p.m. that she gave in and opened her phone, scrolling through updates. Her heart sank. New closures. New travel restrictions. New cases announced all over the country. Suddenly, this distant threat wasn’t so distant anymore.</p><p>Andrea glanced at the calendar on her wall, her eyes landing on the box holding today’s date. March 10, 2020. It now felt oddly monumental, ominous even. Tomorrow, everything would change. She didn’t know how, didn’t know to what extent, but she could sense a dividing line forming in the air—separating what was normal from what was about to come.</p><p>She wouldn’t commute to work tomorrow. She wouldn’t meet Clara for lunch at their favorite deli. She wouldn’t instinctively reach out for a handshake during meetings or brush off the news as hype.</p><p>Andrea poured herself another glass of wine and sat silently on her couch, staring at the ticking second hand of her wall clock. This was the last normal day. She hadn’t realized it until now, but a part of her already missed it.</p><p>As the quiet settled around her small apartment, Andrea thought about what the future might look like. Masks. Distance. Uncertainty. She couldn’t wrap her mind around it yet—it all felt impossible. But as midnight approached, bringing with it the dawn of a new, unfamiliar reality, she promised herself one thing: she would remember today. Every detail, every mundane moment. Because once normal was gone, it would take on a value she never imagined before.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/pandemic-stories/>Pandemic Stories</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-last-normal-day-a-pandemic-short-story/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Last Normal Day: A Pandemic Short Story</span>
