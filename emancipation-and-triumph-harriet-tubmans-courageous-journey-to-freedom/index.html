Though she was just a small girl, she observed the injustices and cruelties of slavery that surrounded her.</p><p>Harriet was born in 1820 into a family of slaves. Her mother, Rit, and her father, Ben, were both slaves on the plantation of Dr. Anthony Thompson. The plantation was quite large, with many enslaved people working in the fields and performing various tasks. Among these enslaved people were Harriet&rsquo;s grandparents and other family members.</p><p>Harriet&rsquo;s early years were spent working as a house servant. Despite the harsh working conditions and the brutality of her owners, she managed to keep her spirit intact. She would hear stories from her elders that spoke of a time when slavery did not exist, and of a world where all people were free.</p><p>These stories fueled her dreams and her determination to live a life free from the chains of slavery. And so, at the age of 17, she made her escape. With the help of the Underground Railroad, and many courageous individuals who risked their own lives to assist her, Harriet successfully escaped the bondage of slavery and made her way to freedom in the free state of Pennsylvania.</p><p>But Harriet&rsquo;s journey was far from over. She knew that she had a duty to help others who were still confined to the cruel world of slavery. She joined the Underground Railroad, which was a secret network of people and safe places that helped enslaved individuals escape to freedom.</p><p>Harriet proved to be a remarkable conductor on the Underground Railroad, guiding over 70 enslaved individuals to freedom. Her skill in navigating the dangerous paths through the Appalachian wilderness earned her the nickname &ldquo;Moses.&rdquo; But this was not the only way she demonstrated her courage.</p><p>In Maryland, a state known for its ruthless slave hunters, Harriet returned to the very plantations from which she had escaped. Despite the extreme risks involved, she returned under the cover of night to lead her fellow enslaved friends to freedom. She did this for ten consecutive missions, risking her life each time, bringing others to the path of freedom.</p><p>But Harriet&rsquo;s exploits were not confined to her work in the Underground Railroad. When the Civil War broke out, she volunteered as a nurse, using her local knowledge and intimate understanding of the landscape to guide Union forces through the dangerous Maryland countryside. The impact of her efforts can be seen in the victories of various maneuvers and troop movements that pushed back the Confederate forces.</p><p>After the Civil War ended and slavery was abolished, Harriet continued to fight for the rights of African Americans. She was a vocal advocate for women&rsquo;s suffrage and remained a public speaker, sharing her incredible story with gatherings across the country.</p><p>In her later years, she worked tirelessly to ensure that the rights of African Americans were protected, and she fought for equal education and job opportunities. She often said, &ldquo;I would be glad of the change abstractions when broken down to realities mean to me. When I say, &lsquo;We&rsquo; it means women – and when I say &lsquo;women,&rsquo; I mean women of all colors.&rdquo;</p><p>Harriet Tubman passed away on March 10, 1913, at the age of 91. Her legacy of courage and determination has forever left a mark on American history. Even today, her story serves as an inspiration to those who fight for justice and equality, and it will continue to resonate for generations to come. As a humble but persistent force for change, Harriet Tubman&rsquo;s triumph over adversity remains an enduring symbol of hope and liberation in America&rsquo;s history.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/historical-figures/>Historical Figures</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/einsteins-revolutionary-mind-the-man-behind-the-theory-of-relativity/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Einstein's Revolutionary Mind: The Man Behind the Theory of Relativity</span>
