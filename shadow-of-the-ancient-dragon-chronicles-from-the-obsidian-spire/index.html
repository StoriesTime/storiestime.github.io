Thaurion, fabled to be the cradle of civilization and of arcane sorcery, bore the marks and feats of its illustrious history - one marred by peril and, yet, sacred by the legendary Ancient Dragon, Ingwel.</p><p>Ingwel, last survivor of the legendary Kundran Dynasty, had brought to the kingdom an era of enlightenment and dread, perhaps, the two warring entities that bound so tightly and powerfully people&rsquo;s fate. Within the winding curls of his royal serpentine tail, and piercing emerald eyes, lay a dormant force - one that could cleave the moon from the heavens and meld the stars to create new galaxies.</p><p>Long ago, while the celestial bodies witnessed mankind’s rise from its cradle of mud and bone, kings and warlords, mages and acolytes sought Ingwel’s guidance. For the Ancient Dragon was thought to harbor secrets of the Primordial Aether, a coveted power; a boundless, otherworldly energy, pulsating with the birth and death of galaxies which could provide immortality, or the power to shatter reality.</p><p>Upon a twilight when dusk firmly clasped its fingers around the realm, veiling the world in shades of sapphire, indigo, and midnight, a young mage stood resolute upon the precipice of the Obsidian Spire. Malik, born into the sorcerous House of Rumelar, had devoted years of study and craft to unravel the mysteries of Thaurion&rsquo;s ancient tomes and arcane artifacts, desperately searching for the answer to power the kingdom&rsquo;s salvation. As the night chill nibbled at his exposed skin, he whispered the incantation into the abyss; its words powerful, crisp and intense, forming a resonance that awakened the echoes of the Primordial Aether. A spectral shadow, sparked by Malik&rsquo;s endeavors, rippled outwards, spiraling up into the blackened sky where it fused with Ingwel&rsquo;s luminous mark, leaving behind a spiraling dance of shadows and the star-filled cosmos.</p><p>With the fated twilight fast approaching on their third cycle, an ominous shadow began to cast itself across the Obsidian Spire. Its undulating silhouette heralded the return of Ingwel, bearing a luminous aura that pulsed with molten gold and smoldering obsidian. The dragon&rsquo;s arrival heralded not only power, knowledge, and salvation but also the somber reminder of the dark enchantment that had bound his essence with the kingdom of Thaurion.</p><p>Yet, to the denizens of Thaurion, the night brought not dread but relief. For they had suffered their darkness, a siege wherein they faced famine, disease, and despair. Regrettable, the citizens would never forget the horrors they had witnessed upon the countless whispers of their enemies.</p><p>The dark enchantment which bound Ingwel to Thaurion now lay on the precipice of its inevitable conclusion. For decades, the fervent hopes of the kingdom rested in the observances and sacrifices made in honor of the titan who stared into the hearts of men and whispered the secrets of eternity.</p><p>Blood and flames, piety and madness!</p><p>As the story unfurled through the ages, so too did the shadows of the dragon&rsquo;s furrowed wingbeats against the sable sky. Malik, with his newfound enlightenment of the Primordial Aether, had learned the tale of the fateful binding that etched the mark of Ingwel upon the kingdom&rsquo;s spirit.</p><p>During the years of the Great Schism, the realm was torn asunder by the jealous machinations of the surviving powers, determined to subdue the Ancient Dragon for their own ends. Through unyielding faith and the steadfast unshakable belief in the benevolence of the dragon, the remaining citizens of Thaurion formed a great covenant; a bond of peace and unity that their predecessors had not known; thus binding Ingwel&rsquo;s mark to the realm and securing his services.</p><p>But the covenant came with a price. To forge this sacred promise, the Ancient Dragon had absorbed the essence of a revered sorceress, her stolen spark imprisoning within him a weakened force that swelled with darkness. Thus, he had become infused with an inextinguishable brooding that echoed within the marrow of his bones.</p><p>As the heavens, marked with the sprinkling of stardust adhered to his serpentine scales, sparkled and fizzled, sending Kaleidoscopic glimmers that danced upon the figure of a cloaked shadow being drawn near, a figure emerged from the obsidian veil. It approached, her long reddish-brown hair adorned with a golden diadem, her deep green eyes reflecting the celestial canvas above the dragon.
&ldquo;Lady Aramazda, your faith did not fail us,&rdquo; the dragon greeted as his eyes flickered with a mellow amber glow. Like many foretold in the chronicles, she was the light that guided the kingdom during those turbulent times, the pillar that held the flames of hope burning high.</p><p>With the passing of each eon, Thaurion was forged by countless hands of kings, warlords, and sorcerers. Sublime heroes and bitter despots alike cast their influence upon its fate. Yet, amidst the chaos of history, the kingdom remained dedicated to the preservation of its covenant with Ingwel.</p><p>&ldquo;Majestic Ingwel, we are here today at the culmination of the cycle, bearing before thee an offering of our continued devotion. With diligent hearts, we have harvested the essence of mankind’s possession - the embodiment of their hopes, sorrows, and memories - a tribute we embark upon every twilight cycle,"-Aramezda said, extending a chalice made of black obsidian, enchanted by the blood of countless selfless heroes and adorned in the crest of the Ancient Dragon.</p><p>With a great heave of his massive serpent body, Ingwel bent low, and his great hood unfolded, revealing the chalice within his feral maw. The tip of his forked tongue bore the offering as he graced the people of Thaurion with a sight rarely witnessed - an utterance of his gratitude, a shimmering aurora dancing across his iridescent scales, a celestial rift bridging man and the arcane sovereignty unto which their destiny was wed.</p><p>And as the sanctified twilight gave way to the foreboding of its successor, a transformation had taken hold. The kingdom of Thaurion bathed in the enchanting glow of the Primordial Aether, the shadows of the dragon casting an ever-dance of luminous patterns upon the ancient citadel. For it was said that ingwel once proclaimed,</p><p>&ldquo;Let every soul that passes under my shadow continue to draw strength and resilience, their hearts being invaluable currency in the race against history.”</p><p>The story of Ingwel, the Ancient Dragon, and his covenant with the people of Thaurion echoed throughout the ages. As the years amassed and the kingdom expanded, the tales of the dragon&rsquo;s ancient veneration brought forth a unity and reverence that transcended the tides of time. Thus, amidst the whispers of their enemies did Thaurion grow, strengthened by the covenant of the Obsidian Spire that echoed the sanctity of the arcane world. For, within the realm of shadows and celestial wonders, they found solace in the eternal bond that connected them with the heart of the cosmos.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/fantasy-worlds/>Fantasy Worlds</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/secrets-of-the-moonlit-cavern/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Secrets of the Moonlit Cavern</span>
