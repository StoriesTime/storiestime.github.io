The moon, swollen and luminous, cast a pale light over the wild brambles and tangles of ivy that choked the pathway leading to Thornspire Keep. In the distance, the structure loomed like a monument to sorrow, its jagged towers clawing at the sky.</p><p>Lysa stepped forward, her boots crunching against the gravel. Her cloak, worn and weathered, billowed behind her in the wind. She gripped the hilt of her blade tightly, its familiar weight an anchor to the tempest of emotions swirling inside. It had been six years since she last walked this path, six years since her closest ally—her brother in arms—had betrayed her.</p><p>The memory cut sharper than any sword. Garlen’s hollow smile, his hand reaching for hers in a gesture of comfort, while the dagger hidden in his sleeve found her back. She trusted him, as one does a shadow that moves with their every step, and he had sold her to those who sought her death. Left to die in the dungeons of Marrowhold, Lysa had clawed her way free, fueled by rage and an unrelenting resolve for vengeance.</p><p>Tonight, her vengeance would find its mark.</p><p>The keep seemed to whisper her name, beckoning her forward with ghostly echoes. Lysa tightened her grip on her sword, its blade honed to uncanny sharpness. She had spent years preparing for this moment: studying Garlen’s habits, tracking his network, piecing together the puzzle of his betrayal. He had risen high in the ranks of the Crimson Syndicate, and Thornspire was now his stronghold.</p><p>Years ago, she wouldn&rsquo;t have believed such power was within his reach. They had been warriors for hire, mercenaries chasing the promise of coin and glory. Together, they had braved burning deserts, treacherous tundras, and battles so fierce they left scars etched deep into their skin and souls. Their camaraderie had felt eternal, unbreakable.</p><p>Until gold proved a stronger bond than honor.</p><p>The halls of the keep stretched before her, silent save for the distant murmur of voices. Shadows danced along the stone walls, their movement mocking her with fleeting glimpses of silhouettes that disappeared just as suddenly. Lysa’s instincts sharpened. She knew these corridors would be heavily guarded, and a direct assault would only end in her demise. Stealth had been her ally in the years of exile and survival, and she would rely on it now.</p><p>Sliding past arcane braziers that cast crimson light, she ducked into narrow alcoves carved into the walls. She took out the map she&rsquo;d memorized—a stolen artifact from one of Garlen’s lieutenants—and traced her destination. The throne room. That’s where he would be, holding court among his treacherous kin, basking in the power he had stolen with blood and deceit.</p><p>With every step, memories tumbled into her mind, unbidden and raw. Garlen laughing as he bandaged her wounds after a skirmish. Garlen muttering curses under his breath as they shared stale bread by a dying fire. Garlen standing beside her against impossible odds, their blades flashing like twin meteors.</p><p>She shook her head. That Garlen was long gone.</p><p>A guard passed by, heavy boots echoing on the cold stone. Lysa froze, concealed in a cleft of shadow. The guard’s sword reminded her of the countless battles she’d fought alongside Garlen, but she pushed the sentiment away. Experience had taught her that feelings were liabilities tonight. Vengeance left no room for sentiment.</p><p>The throne room doors loomed ahead. Ornately carved, they stood as a barrier between her and the man responsible for stealing everything she&rsquo;d ever believed in. She pressed her ear against the cold wood and listened. Muffled laughter drifted through—a sound she recognized instantly.</p><p>Garlen.</p><p>The man who had once been her brother stood at the center of the chamber, surrounded by sycophants. Lysa peeked through the slight crack in the door. His laugh was still the same—boisterous and full of life—but there was an edge to it now, a glint of cruelty that hadn’t been there before. She clenched her jaw. He had the mark of a man who thrived on betrayal.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve outdone yourself again, my lord,&rdquo; one of his lackeys said, raising a goblet. &ldquo;The Crimson Syndicate owes you their fortunes and their future.&rdquo;</p><p>Garlen waved a hand dismissively. &ldquo;Fortunes come and go,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but power&mldr; power remains eternal. Thornspire is mine now, and no one—not even the ghosts of my past—can take it from me.&rdquo;</p><p>Lysa pushed the door open, slowly, silently. Rage burned in her chest as she stepped into the room, staying in the shadows along its edges. Garlen’s words ignited something primal inside her. Her fingers twitched, itching to draw her blade and end his reign with a single, decisive strike. But this was not a moment for haste. She wanted him to know who had come for him.</p><p>The torchlight flickered as she emerged into the center of the room. Conversation ceased; laughter died. Garlen froze, his goblet halfway to his lips. His eyes locked on hers, recognition dawning slowly, followed by surprise, then disbelief.</p><p>&ldquo;Lysa&mldr;&rdquo; he whispered, his voice suddenly devoid of arrogance.</p><p>The gathered lackeys began to shift uneasily, as though sensing the weight of the storm that had arrived. Lysa stepped forward, each pace carefully measured. Her sword gleamed in the crimson glow of the chamber, its edge singing with purpose.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you think I&rsquo;d perish in that dungeon?&rdquo; she asked, her voice steady, cold. &ldquo;Did you think your betrayal would erase me?&rdquo;</p><p>Garlen set the goblet down, his hands trembling slightly. &ldquo;It was never meant to be like this,&rdquo; he said hurriedly. &ldquo;You don’t understand—&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You made me understand,&rdquo; Lysa snapped, cutting him off. She pointed her sword at him, its tip steady. &ldquo;You taught me that trust is a weakness.&rdquo;</p><p>Something unreadable flashed across his face—regret, perhaps, or fear. Then, as though remembering he was surrounded by his loyalists, his expression hardened. The old, hollow smile returned, but it no longer had the power to disarm her.</p><p>&ldquo;And what do you plan to do, Lysa?&rdquo; he asked as he stepped away from his throne. His voice regained its sharpness, his confidence like armor. &ldquo;Kill me? Take my place? Revenge is a fool’s errand, and you’ll gain nothing but an empty victory.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For me,&rdquo; Lysa said, &ldquo;revenge is its own reward.&rdquo;</p><p>With those final words, she lunged. Her movements were fluid and lethal, the culmination of years spent preparing for this confrontation. Garlen drew his own blade, and their weapons clashed, sparking like fireflies in the dim chamber. The gathered lackeys scrambled away, creating a circle of spectators around the two combatants.</p><p>Each swing of her sword was deliberate, and each block he made was desperate. The battle was a dance of shadows and steel, echoes of their former camaraderie resonating in the rhythm of combat. Somewhere deep inside, she wondered if Garlen had expected her to come for him all along, or if he had believed his betrayal would remain unanswered.</p><p>His blade faltered as she pressed him harder, her fury enhancing her precision. Years of gilded comfort had dulled his sharpness, while her years of suffering had forged her into a weapon. She sensed his desperation as his defenses crumbled, and her blade found its mark—a deep slash across his side.</p><p>Garlen staggered, blood blossoming across his tunic. He looked at her with wide eyes, unspoken words caught in his throat.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; he choked out, sinking to his knees. &ldquo;Revenge&mldr; is its own reward.&rdquo;</p><p>And then his head lowered, his strength fading, the weight of his betrayal dragging him down. Lysa stood over him, her blade gleaming with crimson under Thornspire&rsquo;s light. The silence in the chamber was suffocating.</p><p>She stepped back, staring at the man who had once been her brother but became her betrayer. She let her sword slide back into its sheath, ignoring the stunned murmurs of the lackeys around her. What came next would be their choice—flee, follow her, or perish as he had.</p><p>Thornspire&rsquo;s gates groaned once more as Lysa walked out, her figure disappearing into the night, the storm inside her finally quelled.</p><p>Her vengeance had taken its toll.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/betrayal-and-revenge/>Betrayal and Revenge</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/when-loyalty-breaks-a-dark-tale-of-revenge/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>When Loyalty Breaks: A Dark Tale of Revenge</span>
