The trees whispered secrets that she couldn&rsquo;t decipher, as their tender leaves fluttered around her like desperate souls seeking liberation.</p><p>She had gazed into the eyes of her childhood friend, Sebastien, just hours before. They were the same shade of grey as the stormy sky before the thunderstorm breaks. But she saw a stranger in his gaze – a man that belonged to a world she could barely grasp. She saw the imprints of betrayal that dwelled within his eyes – his past etched in the faint lines that emerged from the corners.</p><p>As he betrayed her trust, his loops of lies engulfed her surroundings, infusing the air with a coppery tinge that somehow beached itself within her lungs. Lila was taken aback by the realization that her understanding of duty and loyalty had been nothing more than tattered threads. She did not know what to trust anymore, but the need to flee devoured her like a ravenous beast bursting into flames, leaving only smoldering ash in the quest for vengeance.</p><p>The forest seemed to swallow her into its inky black depths. Her feet led her on a path unknown. Her thoughts grappled with the bewildering glimpse of betrayal that left her question her role in this dilemmatic labyrinth.</p><p>The stars above danced with her disbelief, as hushed shadows dipped and played in the moonlit forest. Lengwë, the silver wolf, had always kept a vigilant watch around their village. These woods, his undisturbed sanctuary, had become the nightmare his eyes couldn&rsquo;t have been anticipating.</p><p>As she ventured further into Mahrang Forest, Lila couldn&rsquo;t shake the call of duty she shared with Sebastien. Born in folklore of their ancestors, they were youthful defenders of the village, but on a day a boy betrayed his friend, destiny twisted and tore away a thread from her life&rsquo;s tapestry.</p><p>Lila peered over her shoulder, she saw Sebastien, nearing the bridge where the old inkwell-tree cast its mysterious roots. He screamed curses at her, shadows looming around him like the venomous serpents of the dark empire they had fought tooth and nail to expel.</p><p>Her heart crashed violently against her chest as she remembered that betrayal began as whispers in the deep spring nights of innocence when secrets started hatching from their hideout, pooling into the hidden pond where the serpent lilies would struggle for release.</p><p>She glanced at the enchanted bridge, finding it permanently obscured by the thin veil of Mahrang&rsquo;s secrets. Upon it, none who crossed were ever thought of as the same. The boundary dissolved, it seeped within the roots of the ancient trees, its echoes resonating through the woodland echoes.</p><p>Her steps faltered, her voice restrained by the desperate forbearance necessary to combat the haunting echoes of betrayal encased in the air around her. Lila moved in the twilight enveloping the forest as if it had not known the sunshine of her laughter or the shared dreams of love and loyalty.</p><p>The darkness burgeoned around her, the trees entwined and crashed together in a dance begging to reveal the heart of the forest where the whispers of betrayed loyalty tumbled and lifted like leaves enveloped by a gentle zephyr’s caress.</p><p>The silver wolf melodies from yesteryears floated from her lips, but seemed to be swallowed by the wilderness. Woven through the spectral trees, her thoughts clung to a time when trust surpassed bloodlines, when Lila and Sebastien were bound in the youthful innocent solace of their fortress.</p><p>Lost and hopelessly entangled, Lila&rsquo;s brooding eyes beheld the moon&rsquo;s brilliance which echoed her name upon Mahrang&rsquo;s silvered surface. From her ancestresses, she had inherited the gift of sight – visions of seers and the whispers of fate.</p><p>The oppressive silence held her breath captive within its spectral embrace, urging her to hold on to the remnants of innocence that would be shattered in the face of defiance. Lila&rsquo;s eyes probed into the thick shadows, the echo of the forest pulsing under her frantic fingers.</p><p>A sharp breeze rustled the leaves, bearing the scents of her childhood etched within the distant memories – the smell of earth mingling with the blooming perfume of the sprightly flowers by the riverbanks, the fragrance of the familiar village marketplace and the warmth of a tender, pre-broken heart.</p><p>For hours, the path before Lila seemed to change and twist, and the burden of dusk weighed heavy upon her heart. A flicker of recognition burst to life within the sacrifice of time; the enchanted bridge unveiled its secrets, to be revealed to none other than herself.</p><p>The manipulation of silence was broken; the hushed forest divulged a chorus of echoes as they sang in tongues of betrayal. The culmination of hidden darkness screamed between the divine markings on the pathway of shadows. Thin slivers of light pierced the hearts of trees, falling upon the bridge as though the situation called for the attention of the celestial scribes.</p><p>Lila spanned across the bridge leading to the heart of Mahrang Forest. The echo of betrayal danced with the treacherous wolves that howled after her, as she walked through the path unveiled by destiny. History chose her to uncover Sebastien’s betrayal, to dissect her own role in the twisted webbing of shadows, to confront the dormant conflict within.</p><p>With every step, anger rooted deeply, confessing her pain with every heavy breath. The moonlight sprayed its silver as the twilight faded – the village of two seemed to be left far beyond the silhouette of her trembling silhouette in the silvered heart of Mahrang Forest.</p><p>Lila knew she had no choice but to be the one who carried the whispers of impending doom; the guide to recovering her village, her friend, and her own identity bastardized by the feverish betrayal laid upon her like a shroud.</p><p>As she approached the heart of Mahrang, she knew she had to unveil the echoes of betrayal in order for the dawn to grace her heart with its cleansing morning light – to ask the elder tree to release Sebastien from the deadly shackles he had tied his own life to and restore the trust they sought to protect.</p><p>But as she approached, the village stood silent. Too silent. For unbeknownst to Lila, the echoes of betrayal she carried within her had twisted and danced in Mahrang Forest’s epicenter, weaving their lies amongst the roots of the inkwell-tree, which whispered secrets of corrupted resolution.</p><p>Sebastien stood at the edges of her vision, betraying the solace she traveled for. With eyes that once foresaw her sincerity, he delivered each arrow with precision and arrogance, intent on shattering the legacy of sisterhood that had overpowered them all.</p><p>Lila&rsquo;s heart faltered under the burden as her hands felt for the familiar clay censer, bursting with the strongest jasmine perfume she could find. Within it, her childhood friend would be impaled, a prisoner silenced by his own uncanny deceit. As her hand, molded by time and revenge, held the arrow, she realized she would need to extinguish the metal’s brightness to restore herself and avenge the betrayal etched within the heart of Mahrang.</p><p>Wrapping her fingers around the shaft of the bow, she felt Sebastien&rsquo;s eyes upon her – not those of a boy she once trusted, but those of a man entangled in his maddening betrayal. Lila closed her eyes, centering her focus, her determination, and her own rage.</p><p>The clapper within her heart hit the sides of her soul, and resonating within Mahrang Forest, Lila’s harmony with the spirits entwined around the blade and the betrayal-projected shadows which danced.</p><p>Upon the final echo of betrayal fluttering, she released. Her arrow sang a song of breaking silence, cutting through the deceitful veil which surrounded her childhood companion. The silver wolf’s cry as it twisted around her became the melody she had once known, entwining with the earthy scent of her truth – the determination of her resolve.</p><p>Lila stared into the forest, confronting the pitter-patter that alerted her of the rain-like tears now cascading onto the forsaken battleground that once held footsteps of their unity.</p><p>In the distance, the inkwell-tree suddenly blushed. The roots unfurled upon the sky, the moonlight that orchestrated silvered life inside the belly of the tree covered the bloodstained earth. Sebastien, vanquished by his treachery, crumpled into a knot beside the sacrificial clay censer filled with jasmine blooms, bringing the overwhelming scent of her past to life once more.</p><p>And standing amidst Mahrang Forest, Lila embraced the echoes of betrayal. They became the resounding drums, beating steadily against the inner walls of her heart, beginning the restoration of her village to normalcy. The echoes sang with an omen that she had journeyed far away from the youth that had rusted against the betrayal that scorched her heart.</p><p>In the twilight of the new day, the heart of Mahrang Forest revealed its tender pulse. With Lila’s sorrow, ire, and vengeance, the village noises returned to their tranquil lulls.</p><p>And as the silver light from the inkwell-tree embraced the Earth, a new dawn unfurled for Lila to face the world that dwelled within her – a world forged from unity and the unyielding bond of sisterhood entwined in the shadows of Mahrang Forest.</p><hr><h4 id=heading></h4><p>&lt;|end_of_text|>://pinterest.github.io</p><p>This post was anonymously posted on <a href=https://www.pinterest.com>www.pinterest.com</a> by an enthusiast on 06/16/2019.
