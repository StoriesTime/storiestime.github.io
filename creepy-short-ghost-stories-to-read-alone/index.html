It stretched its inky fingers through the cracked windows of my old house, wrapping around me as I sat with only a flickering candle to keep company. There’s something oddly comforting about reading ghost stories alone—not because the tales soothe, but because they provoke a primal thrill, a delicious chill spiraling down the spine. Tonight, I’ve gathered a few short ghost stories, whispered in the dark nooks of forgotten places. Each one provokes a unique unease, a creeping sensation best experienced when the world outside falls silent.</p><hr><h2 id=the-man-in-the-wallpaper>The Man in the Wallpaper</h2><p>Sarah moved into the century-old Victorian hoping to find peace. The house had a charming personality: curly woodwork, windows etched with frost patterns, and walls lined with faded floral wallpaper. But at night, Sarah noticed a figure pressed eerily flat against the wallpaper in her bedroom. At first, she thought it was a trick of the shadows cast by the moonlight. But as the nights wore on, the figure became clearer—a gaunt man, pale face pushed against the floral design, eyes wide and unblinking.</p><p>She tried to tear the wallpaper down, but no matter how much she peeled, the man stayed trapped beneath, inching closer night by night. One evening, when Sarah finally gathered the courage, she whispered, “Who are you?” The man’s lips parted, revealing a faint smile.</p><p>“I’m the one who never left.”</p><hr><h2 id=the-last-passenger>The Last Passenger</h2><p>Tom was a night-shift cab driver, a job demanding patience and resilience. One fog-slicked night, he picked up a woman in a silver raincoat from the outskirts of town. She asked to be driven to a remote farmhouse, miles beyond the last streetlamp’s glow. As they drove, the radio crackled strange static, and Tom’s rearview mirror reflected the woman’s face—a stark, ghostly pallor that hadn&rsquo;t been there moments before.</p><p>When they arrived, the woman vanished, leaving behind a chilling residue of cold. He knocked on the farmhouse door, but only an elderly man answered. “My daughter?” the man whispered. “She’s been missing for twenty years&mldr; said she’d take a ride home one last time.”</p><hr><h2 id=the-laughing-bell>The Laughing Bell</h2><p>In an old clock tower, before the city’s first light, a strange bell tolls by itself. No mechanism seems to cause it, no wind or animal disturbance. Residents nearby call it the Laughing Bell. Legend says it starts laughing right before someone vanishes.</p><p>Late one night, curious teenager Mia sneaked into the tower, hoping to record the sound. Minutes before midnight, the bell began its ghastly giggle—a hollow, mirthless chuckle that rattled the air. Suddenly, Mia realized she was not alone; a shadow slipped from the bell’s shadow, whispering a chilling invitation, “Come play.”</p><p>Hours later, Mia’s phone was found near the tower, recording nothing but echoes and the faint sound of distant laughter.</p><hr><h2 id=the-portraits-gaze>The Portrait’s Gaze</h2><p>The old family estate displayed an eerie painting—a portrait of a stern-looking woman whose eyes seemed to follow visitors. Helena, a curious art student staying there for research, scoffed at the superstition. One night, she stayed up, staring into those painted eyes, challenging her to blink first.</p><p>As the clock chimed midnight, the eyes shimmered; the painted woman’s lips curved into a sinister smirk. Helena felt the oppressive air around her grow thick, her heartbeat syncing with a slow, creeping dread. The next morning, the portrait’s eyes were closed, and Helena was gone. Only the faint scratch of a brushstroke remained on the canvas.</p><hr><h2 id=the-silent-lullaby>The Silent Lullaby</h2><p>Anna often visited her grandmother’s old home, a place thick with family memories and, sometimes, a restless weight in the air. As a child, she remembered a lullaby that drifted through the night, soft and unnerving. Its melody was beautiful yet hollow, empty of warmth.</p><p>One evening, Anna followed the lullaby’s faint trail to the attic, where a music box sat atop a heap of forgotten keepsakes. It was playing on its own, and the air was frigid. To her horror, the lullaby was not just music but a call. The attic shadows stretched toward her, whispering secrets of those who never left, their voices stitched to that haunting melody.</p><hr><h2 id=the-midnight-visitor>The Midnight Visitor</h2><p>James had just moved into his new apartment, high above the city streets. On his first night alone, the clock struck twelve, and he heard a knock—soft but deliberate—at the door. Peeking through the peephole, nothing was there. He opened it to empty hallway silence.</p><p>Night after night, the knocking repeated at midnight, growing louder, more insistent. One night, against his better judgment, James opened the door again and stepped outside. The hallway transformed; walls bled shadows, whispers clogged the air.</p><p>A figure emerged from the darkness: a child, translucent and weeping. &ldquo;Why do you call me?&rdquo; it asked. James, shaking, whispered, &ldquo;I don’t know. Who are you?&rdquo;</p><p>The child’s voice was barely a breath: &ldquo;The one who waits for doors to open to the forgotten.&rdquo;</p><hr><h2 id=behind-closed-doors>Behind Closed Doors</h2><p>In a small town’s forgotten hotel, room 217 never had a guest. Not because of poor reviews, but because every guest who tried to stay there reported nightmares and strange noises—footsteps pacing, whispering voices behind the walls, and the faint scent of perfume long faded.</p><p>James, a skeptic writing an article on haunted locations, checked in, determined to debunk the stories. At the stroke of midnight, a knock sounded from inside the room though doors were locked tight. A silhouette appeared behind the wallpaper—a woman pleading silently for help.</p><p>By dawn, James had vanished. The cleaning staff found only his camera, its last photos showing the woman’s anguished face pressed against the wallpaper.</p><hr><h2 id=the-endless-corridor>The Endless Corridor</h2><p>Emma was drawn to an abandoned asylum, curious for the tales of its haunted halls. Wandering through the labyrinthine corridors, she stumbled into a room she’d never seen before—a long hallway that stretched impossibly far, illuminated by flickering fluorescent lights.</p><p>As she walked, the walls began closing in, doors that should have been locked creaked open, revealing shadowy figures. She turned to leave but found the corridor stretching endlessly behind her, loops folding upon themselves like twisted reflections.</p><p>A voice echoed softly, “Some corridors have no end, only those who enter.”</p><hr><h2 id=voices-from-the-well>Voices from the Well</h2><p>In a rural village, an old well sat at the edge of the woods, known for voices calling from its depths. Locals warned children never to listen too closely. Legend said the well trapped souls of those who whispered secrets in its waters.</p><p>One night, Jason, daring and defiant, leaned over the well’s edge. The voices grew louder, turning into desperate pleas. He heard his own name whispered among them. Frozen in fear, Jason realized the water&rsquo;s surface was not water but a dark mirror, reflecting faces twisted in sorrow.</p><hr><hr><p>Each story draws threads from places forgotten, shadows that linger, and echoes that call when silence falls. These whispered tales aren&rsquo;t just entertainment—they’re an invitation to peer into corners where daylight doesn’t reach, to listen for the murmurs beneath the creak of old floorboards, and to wonder what&rsquo;s crawling beneath your own skin when you read these stories… alone.</p><p>Sometimes, the most unsettling ghosts are those we invite in by choice—the stories we nestle into our minds in the dark, where imagination riffs on reality, and the ordinary shivers into the extraordinary.</p><p>Should you dare to read another? The shadows wait.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/ghost-stories/>Ghost Stories</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/creepy-haunted-house-ghost-stories-to-read-in-the-dark/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Creepy Haunted House Ghost Stories to Read in the Dark</span>
