The wind howled through the barren trees, whipping them into a frenzy of chaotic movements. In one such chilling night, a young boy named Tim, bundled up in his warmest clothes, ventured into these woods, searching for something he had lost during his last adventure there - a treasured, mysterioustarot card nestled carefully into a rustic wooden box.</p><p>Jim, his dog, trotted by his side, his sizable paws smudging the damp tracks they left in their wake. When they finally reached the small, nondescript clearing where Tim had last seen the precious card, the rain seemed to suddenly ebb into a gentle pitter-patter on the leaves above them, as though the Universe itself wished to assist them in their search.</p><p>After hours of scouring every inch of the ground, they found nothing. Disheartened, they decided it was time to call it a night and head back towards the warmth and comfort of Tim&rsquo;s family home. The wind resumed its merciless demeanor, as if angry that they were leaving – the trees swaying violently as they watched the two of them trudge through the underbrush.</p><p>Almost as if a spell had been broken, the rain began to fall heavily once more, drenching every inch of them. Pulling himself up against a particularly gnarled old trunk, Tim leaned back to catch his breath, his chest heaving as the exertion of the day caught up to him.</p><p>He turned to Jim, who was busily sniffing around at a bush laden with drooping wet leaves. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to be gained here, boy,&rdquo; whispered Tim, the comforting, anthro nature of Jim seemingly welcoming his words. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just get out of here.&rdquo;</p><p>They began to make their way back towards the trail, when suddenly, a glint of gold caught Tim&rsquo;s eye. Squinting between the tangled branches and gnarled roots, he carefully moved forward. Excitement surged through him as Jim wagged his tail expectantly beside him.</p><p>After spotting a small, jagged outcropping nearby, Tim maneuvered around it and almost cried out with relief when he saw the tarot card – no longer nestled in its wooden home. He gently reached for it, his fingers brushing against the same worn image of the chyrsal dragon from their last adventure together. A part of him expected nothing more than disappointment, but instead, his eyes widened with new intrigue as he gazed at the image. It seemed almost as though the card had been touched by an unseen hand, somehow&mldr; enhanced.</p><p>Tim made a mental effort to push aside the peculiar sensation that came over him as he slipped thetarot card into his pocket. Feeling the small bulge in his jeans, he tucked his hands into his armpits, attempting to dry them out as best he could.</p><p>His focus quickly shifted as Jim began to growl deeply in his throat, his hackles raised. Eyes wide, Tim scanned the darkness that had begun to close in around them as the light of day waned further. He could count on one hand the number of times he&rsquo;d heard his dearest companion be on the alert – warnings that had never proven to be in vain.</p><p>Slowly, a ghostly shape emerged from the gloom, sinking into the earth just enough for Tim not to see its entirety. A figure. Two figures. Tim&rsquo;s heart began to race, and he swallowed hard to wet his throat. It was hard to make out any details in the cloak of night, but their intentions were clear: they had eyes that seemed to glint like lanterns, hunting for a meal.</p><p>&ldquo;Who&mldr; who are you?&rdquo; Tim whispered, remembering with surprising vividness his grandfather&rsquo;s oft-told tales about the Night Stalkers - supernatural beings that wandered in the shadows, ever out for prey unaware.</p><p>The tall figures seemed to be communicating telepathically, an eerie silence dominating the conversation. They appeared every bit like the spirits that had hyper-realistically emerged from the mist-covered depths in those tales.</p><p>&ldquo;We mean you no harm,&rdquo; the feminine voice spoke, startling him from his inner musings. &ldquo;We are the Night Stalkers. We are not often encountered&mldr; equally rare are those who deserve our protection. You have shown bravery that transcends your years, proving yourself to be among the few who earn our guidance.&rdquo;</p><p>Tim gulped, but found his voice. &ldquo;Guidance?&rdquo; he croaked. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We will aid you, young one. You were meant to find thattarot card today; it has chosen you. Join us, and your understanding of life, the good, and the evil, will be forever altered&mldr;&rdquo;</p><p>Tim did not need to be told twice. He needed to know why such a simpletarot card would be linked to his destiny. The male Night Stalker, who stood sentry watching over a seemingly sleepy village, nodded solemnly before the two ethereal creatures led him on a journey through the existential mists of moonlit night.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/supernatural-and-paranormal/>Supernatural and Paranormal</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/night-spirits-chilling-supernatural-short-stories/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Night Spirits: Chilling Supernatural Short Stories</span>
