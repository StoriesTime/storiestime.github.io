In fact, aside from a knack for impeccable espresso brewing, there was not a single exceptional thing about him. He came into espionage by accident—or rather, through an immense clerical error at the British Secret Intelligence Service. Somewhere along the line, a delicate file swap during HR onboarding had transformed a mid-tier Whitehall janitor into &ldquo;Agent B-17.&rdquo;</p><p>On the surface, Gerard had everything. He carried a leather briefcase that never seemed to open, a sleek pen that doubled as a malfunctioning laser cutter, and even a code name. But inside? Inside his head was perpetual chaos and an encyclopedic knowledge of cricket trivia, which was wildly unhelpful in the world of clandestine operations.</p><p>This is the story of how Gerard survived his first—and last—assignment.</p><hr><h3 id=a-mission-destined-for-catastrophe>A Mission Destined for Catastrophe</h3><p>It all started in a dimly lit briefing room deep within MI6 headquarters. Gerard had barely seated himself at the oval table when Chief Envoy of Operations, Helena Cross, slapped a thick dossier in front of him.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a high-value target in Estovia,&rdquo; Helena began, leaning forward. &ldquo;A double agent. He’s been leaking classified intel to our adversaries, and we need you to extract him before things turn… complicated.&rdquo;</p><p>Gerard blinked. &ldquo;Estovia? The country with&mldr; the world&rsquo;s largest nutcracker museum?&rdquo;</p><p>Helena narrowed her eyes. &ldquo;Yes. Among other things.&rdquo;</p><p>Gerard cleared his throat and attempted his best &lsquo;serious professional&rsquo; nod. He scribbled &ldquo;Big nutcrackers&rdquo; in his notebook next to an impromptu doodle of an angry squirrel. Surprisingly, Helena continued without noticing—or perhaps without caring.</p><p>“Your cover,” she said, sliding a second folder toward him, “is as a visiting journalist. You’ll make contact with the target, Codename: Sparrow, at Café Balanchève. From there, get him out of the country and deliver him to the safe house on the border. Any questions, Agent B-17?”</p><p>Gerard had dozens, but most were along the lines of “What’s an extraction?” and “Is the Estovian currency the praline or the ducat?” Instead, he muttered, “No, ma’am," because he was rather certain being sent back to janitorial work would be preferable to being publicly humiliated in this very moment.</p><p>&ldquo;Good. Don&rsquo;t mess this up.&rdquo; Helena’s words landed like concrete, full of foreboding.</p><hr><h3 id=the-arrival-in-estovia>The Arrival in Estovia</h3><p>By the time Gerard landed in Estovia, his nerves were shot. Not because he feared failure—oh no, he was entirely oblivious to the stakes. No, Gerard’s anxiety stemmed from trying to fill out a customs form. His handwriting was so illegible that he accidentally declared himself as a &ldquo;illegal importer of pianos.&rdquo;</p><p>Once he cleared customs with alarming ease (thankfully, Estovian customs officials didn’t care much for musical instruments), Gerard focused on blending in. Blending in, in Gerard’s world, meant adjusting his beret at odd angles and repeating phrases like &ldquo;Right-O&rdquo; and &ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; to everyone he encountered, which earned him increasingly suspicious looks from locals.</p><p>Despite the peculiar impressions he left behind, Gerard eventually found Café Balanchève, which emitted a rich aroma of freshly baked bread and cinnamon. His dossier described Sparrow as a bespectacled man with a penchant for crossword puzzles. Spotting the exact details at the corner table, Gerard approached confidently—or so he thought—and knocked over an entire tray of espresso cups in the process.</p><p>Sparrow whipped his head around sharply, pushing his glasses up. &ldquo;Oi! Are you Agent B-17?&rdquo;</p><p>Gerard froze. &ldquo;I—yes, yes, of course! And you&rsquo;re, uh, Birdy?&rdquo;</p><p>The Estovian double agent sighed. &ldquo;Sparrow. Keep the nicknames to yourself, mate.&rdquo; He gestured for Gerard to sit, looking around nervously. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re late. We&rsquo;ve got a problem.&rdquo;</p><p>Gerard leaned in, lowering his voice. &ldquo;What sort of problem? The crossword’s missing a seven-letter word for &lsquo;bungle&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, you imbecile. I&rsquo;ve been exposed.&rdquo; Sparrow handed him what appeared to be a crumpled napkin with Estovian script on it. Gerard squinted; it might as well have been a restaurant receipt.</p><p>&ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; Gerard asked.</p><p>&ldquo;It means,&rdquo; Sparrow hissed, &ldquo;we have approximately thirty minutes before the Estovian secret police arrive. Now, do you have an escape plan?&rdquo;</p><p>Gerard hesitated. Then, he exhaled slowly, projecting an aura of confidence he completely lacked. &ldquo;Of course I do. Follow my lead.&rdquo;</p><hr><h3 id=gerards-flawlessactually-terribleplan>Gerard’s Flawless—Actually, Terrible—Plan</h3><p>Gerard&rsquo;s so-called plan began with commandeering the café&rsquo;s delivery scooter. Sparrow tried to reason with him, explaining that a bright pink scooter adorned with a baguette logo wasn’t exactly conspicuous. Gerard insisted no one would suspect two men escaping international capture on such a vehicle.</p><p>This illusion of anonymity shattered mere moments later when Sparrow shouted, “We’ve got company!” A black SUV screeched into view behind them, unmistakably the secret police. Sparrow regretted every life choice that had led to trusting Gerard as the bumbling &ldquo;spy&rdquo; ignored traffic signs, narrowly avoiding a baby stroller and a produce stall while screaming, “TAKE THE ALLEYS!”</p><p>The alleyway shortcut, however, quickly devolved into chaos as Gerard accidentally led them straight onto a fashion show catwalk. Models were flung left and right as the scooter plowed through, narrowly avoiding a teetering light rig. The audience thought this was some avant-garde performance, erupting into applause as Gerard ramped off the runway and into the Estovian river.</p><hr><h3 id=the-river-chase-it-wasnt-glamorous>The River Chase (It Wasn&rsquo;t Glamorous)</h3><p>“Are you trying to get us killed?" Sparrow coughed, clinging to the handlebars of the now-waterlogged pink scooter floating awkwardly downstream.</p><p>“Nonsense!” Gerard yelled. &ldquo;This is proper evasive action!&rdquo; In truth, he’d never been in a boat before, let alone afloat on what was essentially a moped-shaped raft. The current wasn’t helping matters, steering them nearer and nearer to the approaching Estovian harbor.</p><p>To their dismay, the secret police were unfazed by terrain. A trio of black-clad agents appeared on jet skis bearing an intimidating crest of the Estovian eagle. Gerard gulped.</p><p>&ldquo;Do something!&rdquo; Sparrow barked.</p><p>Gerard fumbled with his malfunctioning pen-laser, finally activating it only to accidentally set the scooter seat on fire. The flames, however, startled the pursuing agents, who veered sharply and collided spectacularly into one another. It was not the laser’s intended purpose, but Gerard nodded smugly. &ldquo;See? I <em>told</em> you I had this covered.&rdquo;</p><hr><h3 id=the-shocking-safe-house>The Shocking Safe House</h3><p>Through sheer luck—or divine intervention—Gerard and Sparrow stumbled ashore not far from the Estovian-Slovobian border. Soaked, singed, and reeking of burnt upholstery, they trekked to the address listed in Gerard’s dossier. The &ldquo;safe house&rdquo; turned out to be a decrepit barn complete with creaky doors and a suspiciously shifty goat tied up outside.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re staying here?&rdquo; Sparrow deadpanned.</p><p>&ldquo;What did you expect? A luxury suite?&rdquo; Gerard replied, attempting to open the barn door. It stuck momentarily before swinging open, revealing none other than Helena Cross herself, flanked by two MI6 agents.</p><p>&ldquo;Agent B-17,&rdquo; Helena said icily. &ldquo;You’re late.&rdquo;</p><p>“Traffic,” Gerard offered. He ignored the way Sparrow slapped his own forehead with exasperation.</p><p>Despite every disaster along the way, Sparrow had been delivered, providing MI6 with critical intelligence. Gerard, somehow, had succeeded.</p><hr><h3 id=an-unlikely-legend>An Unlikely Legend</h3><p>MI6 quietly reassigned Gerard to administrative duties after the infamous Estovia mission. Yet, within the intelligence community, tales of &ldquo;Agent B-17&rdquo; spread like wildfire. Some said he was a genius hiding behind an act of incompetence. Others swore he’d deliberately created chaos as an ingenious diversionary tactic.</p><p>As for Gerard? Well, he returned to perfecting the art of espresso brewing, thoroughly content. After all, not every spy gets to save the day and retire in one piece—especially <em>the world&rsquo;s worst spy</em>.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/comedy-and-humor/>Comedy and Humor</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-great-prank-war-neighbors-gone-wild/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Great Prank War: Neighbors Gone Wild</span>
