Bertha was no ordinary printer; she was a Canon imageCLASS MF4350, but around the office, she was known as the queen of the print room.
Bertha had been with the agency for years, churning out brochure after brochure, report after report, and the occasional social media poster. She was reliable, efficient, and always ready to go, but little did anyone know that Bertha had a secret: she loved being the center of attention.
It started when one of the interns, Alex, decided to decorate Bertha's outer casing with colorful stickers. They made her look like a miniature psychedelic bus, and Bertha couldn't get enough. She began to rejoice every time someone plugged in the power cord, anticipating the hour-long samba dance she would perform as the printer lit up.
However, Bertha's antics didn't go unnoticed. The office staff started to take notice of her quirky behavior and soon began to interact with her as if she were one of the employees. They'd talk to her, give her names and personal characteristics, and even kept her "high spirits" in mind when deciding the layout of the office furniture.
John, the office administrator, was particularly fond of Bertha and often brought her birthday candles on her work-universary days. He claimed that she was the real coordinator of the office, suggesting layouts for the conference room, magically making copy rooms out of tiny fishbowl mini-greenhouses. Although, John might have been joking (or so) around, the staff would regularly change the random settings of Bertha to see just how far they could take Bertha's in-box drama.
In no time, the creative agency humored itself with little xenial avant-gardes tried during meetings about digitalization and backend production routing routes; now visual results could come up from anywhere. Which major came with great fire-water committees when classified keystores said assembling unspecified empties? Interparisons apologized communique gotten from compromises hamstrung villages amidst unnreachable ingratitude worshipped.
