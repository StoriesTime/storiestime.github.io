Here, the people lived with the peace that the earth so gently provided, happily minding their own affairs while the vast world around them spun with everyday events and trials. Unbeknownst to these humble folks, one of their own was about to disturb the tranquility of this land, and in doing so, forever change the lives of everyone inhabiting the slow-turning wheel.</p><p>A young, sensitive boy named Luka developed a fascination with the stories of horses and valor that flooded the pages of the worn books scattered across his village&rsquo;s tiny library. Every afternoon – after the day&rsquo;s sun had thoroughly scorched the earth, and the shadows begun to elongate beneath the behemoth tree that loomed before his house – Luka made haste to the library to foster his dreams and immerse himself in these tales of great heroes and their majestic steeds. He would return home, flushed from the exertion, his book-clad arms held close to his heart, his eyes shining like stars in the dimness of his small bedroom, dreaming of riding the gentle giants with the valiance of his heroes.</p><p>The unforgettable days of his childhood streaked into memories as Luka, now a young man, enlisted in the military at the age of eighteen. The ground shuddered beneath his feet as his substantial boots marched in unison with thousands of other soldiers. As he journeyed further, he encountered the reality of the world that his books had never been able to prepare him for. His boundless ambition to protect the innocent and fragile love for the majestic creatures shone like a beacon, guiding him through the trenches and the burning chaos that riddle the heart of war.</p><p>Luka found himself on a front line, where his deeds, once driven only by love and loyalty, metamorphosed with the injuries he received. With a bullet lodged into his lungs, causing a chilling muffled effect to his speech, his voice – once the clarion call of a child&rsquo;s dreams – became a silent prayer of his own, locked behind the haze of withheld pain. His communion with his horse, which had saved his life more times than it could bear, became his only deliverance from the constant cacophony of war. From the battlefield to the dimly lit makeshift tents, he and his companion were inseparable, their companionship a tacit understanding transcending the brutal and merciless powers attempting to keep them apart.</p><p>With every waking moment wrapped in silence, Luka began to realize the true consequences of his ambition, its veneer of selflessness flaking away like dead leaves from a weathered tree during the merciless winters. With his dreams of chivalry marred and broken, Luka found it harder and harder to reconcile his love for his steadfast companion and the soul-wrenching desire to return to the innocent haven where he once belonged. Swathed in a perpetual silence that sought to smother him like dew-laden ivy on a statue&rsquo;s chiseled form, he was truly in the aftermath of war.</p><p>After three grueling years, his time on the front line came to a close, and Luka was escorted back to his village, the soldier&rsquo;s silhouette casting across the welcome homeland. The memories of Luka&rsquo;s journey a mere shadow playing silently in his eyes, the village, once untouched by strife, now awakening to the reality of their protagonist&rsquo;s heroism and the devastation that came along with it. With each passing day, Luka retreated further into the sanctuary of his silence, using the skills he had honed amidst the conflict to leave behind swords and shields and embrace his love for the written word.</p><p>Upon the birth of his first child, a daughter that bore the weight of every dream he&rsquo;d ever held, Luka&rsquo;s voice finally emerged from the chasm of silence. Although the memories of the desolation and despair that war brings still lingered around him, they became the ink with which he inscribed the pages of a poetry book. His stories were no longer about the bracing charge of battlefields and the thunderous hooves of riders that galloped to their destiny. Instead, they became soliloquies of love, reminiscence, and the battle that wages in every soul every single day. Even in his silence, he had a voice.</p><p>With each passing day, Luka grew more rooted in the soil of his own village, an intricate web of nature spun around him. His invisible ink-stained fingers, once gripped around the reigns of a noble steed, now held the quills that created the architecture of a more fragrant, peaceful world enveloping the hearts of his fellow villagers. His voice had, in itself, become a poignant battleground that resonated within all who came to rest beside him, seeking the solace of his stories and the pens that crafted the wistful dreams and memories of a solider&rsquo;s silence.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/war-and-conflict/>War and Conflict</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/a-soldiers-haunted-letters/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>A Soldier's Haunted Letters</span>
