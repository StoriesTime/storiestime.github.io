The edges were chipped, the glass cracked in multiple places, and the corners had dulled from years of dust. Yet, for as long as Sarah could remember, it had sat on the mantle, next to the fireplace, quietly watching over her childhood home. Every so often, she would find herself gazing at it—at the faded black-and-white photo inside. It was a picture of a smiling young woman, a woman Sarah had never met, her eyes full of something that resembled both joy and sorrow. But what had always intrigued Sarah the most was not the picture itself but the strange whispers she would sometimes hear when she stood too close to the frame.</p><p>It started when Sarah was just a little girl. She had always been sensitive to things others couldn’t see or hear. In the quiet of the night, while everyone else slept, Sarah would hear faint voices coming from the direction of the mantle. The voices weren’t always clear, but there was always something about them that made Sarah shiver with both fear and curiosity.</p><p>“Sarah… Sarah…”</p><p>The whispers seemed to call her name in a hushed, almost desperate tone. At first, she thought it was the wind playing tricks on her. But as she got older, she realized it was something more. The voices weren’t random; they seemed to carry a strange sense of urgency, like someone was trying to tell her something important—something that had been lost in the passage of time.</p><p>One evening, while Sarah was sitting alone in the living room, the voices returned. She had been reading a book, the room dimly lit by the soft glow of a single lamp, when the faint murmurs began again. Her heart raced, and she instinctively turned toward the mantle. There, sitting as it always had, was the old photo frame. The voices seemed to be emanating from it, growing louder, clearer.</p><p>“Sarah, it’s time…”</p><p>Without thinking, Sarah stood up and walked toward the frame. Her hand hovered above it for a moment before she carefully lifted it from the mantle. The glass, though cracked, felt cold against her skin as she held it. The photograph inside showed a woman in her twenties, wearing a long, flowing dress, standing beside a man who appeared to be her husband. Both of them were smiling, their faces full of hope and warmth, but there was something strange in the way their eyes seemed to look beyond the camera, as if they were gazing into the unknown.</p><p>Sarah’s fingers trembled as she adjusted the frame, tilting it just slightly to get a better look at the photo. She had seen it countless times, but tonight, something felt different. Tonight, the image seemed to be pulling her in, like the faces of the people in the photograph were trying to tell her something—something she had never understood.</p><p>And then, the voices came again, this time clearer than ever.</p><p>“Sarah… do you see us?”</p><p>The words were soft but insistent, carrying with them a sense of longing, of unfinished business.</p><p>“Do you hear us?”</p><p>The woman in the photo, the one with the eyes full of sorrow and joy, seemed to be reaching out, her image almost shimmering in the broken glass. Sarah’s breath caught in her throat as she leaned in closer, her eyes fixed on the woman’s face. There was something familiar about her, something that Sarah couldn’t quite place. The longer she stared, the more she felt as if she were being drawn into the image itself, as if the woman’s presence was seeping into her very being.</p><p>“Please…” the voice whispered, now trembling with emotion. “Help us.”</p><p>Before Sarah could respond, a loud crack echoed through the room. The frame slipped from her hands and fell to the floor, the glass shattering into pieces. The room went silent.</p><p>For a moment, Sarah stood frozen, staring at the broken frame. She could feel the remnants of the voices still lingering in the air, like echoes fading into the distance. Slowly, she knelt down and gathered the broken shards of glass, carefully picking them up one by one. As she did, a small piece of paper fluttered out from beneath the frame. It was yellowed with age, its edges frayed. On it was a name—Margaret Willows.</p><p>Something stirred within Sarah at the sight of the name. She didn’t know why, but it felt significant, as though it was a clue to something she needed to understand.</p><p>As she examined the note, the whispers returned, now distant but still haunting.</p><p>“Find her…”</p><p>The voice was faint, but the urgency in it was undeniable. Sarah’s mind raced. Who was Margaret Willows? Why had the photo called to her all these years? She felt a strange compulsion to find out, to uncover the mystery behind the woman in the photograph and the voices that had been haunting her for so long.</p><p>The next morning, Sarah set out to learn more. She visited the local library, hoping to find something that might shed light on the name she had discovered. Hours passed as she combed through old records, local newspapers, and genealogy archives. She found nothing. No mentions of Margaret Willows. No references to the photo, the frame, or the voices. It was as if they had never existed.</p><p>Frustrated but not deterred, Sarah returned to her childhood home that evening. She sat in the living room, the broken photo frame now resting on the coffee table in front of her, its shards glinting in the dim light. As she stared at the pieces, the voices returned once more, soft but insistent.</p><p>“Sarah…”</p><p>The voice was clearer than before, as if it were right next to her. She closed her eyes, listening intently.</p><p>“Sarah, you must listen…”</p><p>This time, the voice was not just a whisper. It was a presence, filling the room, surrounding her. The temperature in the room seemed to drop, and she could hear the faint sound of footsteps, echoing from somewhere beyond the walls.</p><p>Without warning, the room seemed to shift. The shadows deepened, and the photo frame trembled on the table. Sarah’s heart raced as the whispers grew louder, merging into a single voice—no longer just a whisper, but a plea.</p><p>“Sarah… help us…”</p><p>And then, something strange happened. The image in the photograph began to shift. The faces of the man and woman seemed to blur, as if they were moving, as if they were alive. Sarah blinked in disbelief. Was she imagining this? Was her mind playing tricks on her?</p><p>But no, the image was real. The woman’s face, once static, was now full of movement, her eyes wide with desperation, as if she were reaching out to Sarah. The man beside her stood frozen, his face filled with anguish.</p><p>“Help us, Sarah…”</p><p>The voice was stronger now, no longer a whisper but a cry. Sarah’s chest tightened with emotion, her eyes welling with tears. She had to do something. She had to understand what was happening.</p><p>With shaking hands, she picked up the shattered photo frame again, this time carefully peering into the photograph. The woman’s eyes locked with hers, and for a moment, Sarah felt as if she were no longer in her living room. She was standing in another time, another place. She could feel the weight of the woman’s sorrow, her fear, and her longing.</p><p>Suddenly, Sarah understood.</p><p>The woman in the photograph was Margaret Willows. And she was trapped—trapped in the frame, in the glass, in the time before. The voices, the whispers, they had all been her cries for help.</p><p>In that moment, Sarah knew what she had to do. She stood up, her mind made up. The answers lay in the shattered pieces of the photo frame and the name on the note. Margaret Willows was calling out from beyond the glass, and it was Sarah’s destiny to free her.</p><p>The voices began to fade, growing softer until they were nothing more than a distant hum. But Sarah knew they would return—when the time was right, when the pieces of the puzzle were in place. And when they did, she would be ready.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/ghost-stories/>Ghost Stories</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/voices-from-the-grave-real-ghost-encounters-and-tales/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Voices from the Grave: Real Ghost Encounters and Tales</span>
