He had been a professional thief for over three decades, and this was it - his final job. He was getting old, and the risk wasn't worth the reward anymore. His wife, Sarah, had been nagging him for years to retire, and he had finally agreed. The only problem was, he needed one last big score to set him up for life.
Jack's phone buzzed on the table, and he picked it up. It was his old partner, Mike. "Hey, Jack. I've got a job for you," Mike said, his voice low and serious.
"Hold on, Mike," Jack said, getting up to close the window. "I thought we were done with this game."
"We are done," Mike said. "This is just one last job, Jack. I've got a buyer who wants a rare gemstone, and I think we can get it for him."
Jack rubbed his temples, trying to remember the details. He and Mike had pulled off some crazy heists back in the day, but this one seemed different. "What's the gemstone?" Jack asked.
"It's a blue sapphire," Mike said. "Rarely seen, highly valuable. The buyer is willing to pay top dollar, but we need to get it out of a high-security vault in Bangkok."
Jack took a deep breath. This was exactly what he had been trying to get out of. The international scope, the high-stakes, the risk of getting caught&mldr; it was all too much. But he needed the money. He had to see this thing through.
"Okay, Mike," Jack said. "I'm in. But I'm only doing one job, and then I'm out. No more pulling wires, no more slipping out the back door. I'm done."
"You're breaking my heart, Jack," Mike said. "But I get it. I'll talk to the buyer. We'll make the arrangements."
The next few days were a whirlwind of planning and preparation. Jack and Mike worked with a small team of experts to scope out the vault and develop a plan. They flew to Bangkok in a private jet, disguised as a group of wealthy tourists. Jack and Mike had each carried a small bag with their lockpicking gear and a list of passwords.
As they entered the vault, Jack's nerves began to get the better of him. This was it. This was the final job. He took a deep breath, went through the motions, and opened the vault. Inside, they found a display case with the blue sapphire. Jack quickly snapped a photo of the gemstone with a special camera and handed it to Mike, who transmitted it to the buyer.
Once they had the cash and were back on the plane, Jack felt a sense of relief wash over him. It was done. He had gotten out while he still could. When they landed, Jack hailed a taxi and told Mike to take the money and just go. "I'm done, Mike," Jack said. "I need to go home and start my life."
Mike looked at him with a mixture of sadness and understanding. "I know, Jack. I'm proud of you. You've earned it."
As Jack walked away from the taxi, he felt the drizzle of the Seattle rain on his face. It was a fitting end to his career. He hailed another taxi and headed home, where Sarah and his kids were waiting for him. They celebrated with dinner and a bottle of wine.
The next morning, Jack went out onto the back porch, had a cup of coffee, and looked out at the city. He was free. He was done with the game. He could finally live the life he wanted.
Epilogue
Jack spent his days exploring the world with his family and his nights watching TV with Sarah. They traveled to Europe, Australia, and South America. Jack even took up gardening, finding joy in the simple things like growing his own herbs and vegetables.
One day, Jack received a package in the mail with a tracking device. Jack thought it was a sentry on his jerk-only dogs. Upon opening the package, Jack discovered it was a USB drive containing a list of "Best heists" globally.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/robbery-and-heists/>Robbery and Heists</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-final-decoy-when-a-heist-turns-personal/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Final Decoy: When a Heist Turns Personal</span>
