Employees, visitors, and night guards alike have reported strange occurrences—not the obvious kind of fear-inducing phenomena, but something subtler. A soft touch on the shoulder when no one’s around. The scent of lavender lingering near an empty corridor. Sometimes, it’s the faint echo of laughter—soft, melodic, yet out-of-place.</p><p>The beginning of these ghostly tales is as turbulent as the history of the building itself.</p><hr><h3 id=the-construction>The Construction</h3><p>When ground broke for the Empire State Building in 1930, the world was reeling from the onset of the Great Depression. The project, ambitious and grandiose, was heralded as a beacon of hope. But hope often comes with a price. A staggering 3,400 workers toiled day and night to erect the skyscraper at breakneck speed, completing it in just over a year. Ironworkers, bricklayers, electricians—all worked perched precariously hundreds of feet above the city without the safety standards we know today.</p><p>The first whispers of hauntings began during construction itself. Workers spoke of transient shadows flitting along the girders, always visible just from the corner of one’s eye. Tools disappeared, only to reappear days later in locations no one swore they’d touched. Some blamed simple exhaustion. Others were less optimistic, muttering that the construction site was cursed.</p><p>By the time the building was completed in 1931, five workers had died on-site because of accidents such as falling from scaffolds or being crushed by heavy materials. Their names were quietly noted in reports but seldom mentioned during the building’s triumphant unveiling. Yet, those who worked closely on the project began to notice something strange: certain areas of the building seemed heavier, colder, laden with an inexplicable sense of dread. But as the world marveled at the miracle of modern architecture, the whispers of restless spirits were drowned in applause.</p><hr><h3 id=the-woman-in-the-elevator>The Woman in the Elevator</h3><p>One of the building’s most famous apparitions is known simply as the Woman in the Elevator.</p><p>She’s often described as wearing a dress that places her somewhere in the 1940s—tailored, elegant, and just slightly outdated by modern standards. Visitors to the Empire State Building have reported seeing her standing quietly in the corner of the elevator as it ascends to the observation deck. She never speaks, her presence oddly comforting in a crowded elevator.</p><p>That is, until they arrive at the chosen floor, and she’s nowhere to be seen.</p><p>According to an old security guard, the ghostly woman may be tied to a tragic story from the mid-20th century. In 1947, a young woman named Evelyn McHale leaped to her death from the 86th-floor observation deck in an act of despair. Her death was immortalized in a haunting photograph that became iconic—a poignant reminder of the very human tragedies that have unfolded in the midst of greatness. Some believe the Woman in the Elevator is Evelyn herself, wandering the building where her life met its untimely end, though her calm demeanor suggests she may simply be observing, not suffering.</p><hr><h3 id=the-whisperers-of-the-33rd-floor>The Whisperers of the 33rd Floor</h3><p>Among employees, regular workers often share unnerving stories about the 33rd floor—an area said to emanate an eerie energy, even in the middle of the day. One night janitor, Paul Castillo, spoke of hearing faint voices while working there—low murmurs that seemed conversational but unintelligible. When he would approach to investigate, the voices would abruptly stop, leaving only the unsettling silence of the empty floor.</p><p>Around the 1970s, a group of paranormal investigators became so intrigued by the hauntings on the 33rd floor that they attempted to conduct a séance there. The investigators reportedly contacted a spirit who identified himself as a construction worker who had died during the building’s construction, though accounts vary. The worker apparently claimed that he had fallen due to “an accident that wasn’t really an accident.” The cryptic remark left many to wonder whether foul play had occurred during the hurried frenzy of building the structure or if his words were simply the echoes of long-forgotten trauma.</p><p>To this day, the custodial staff avoids working alone on that floor.</p><hr><h3 id=the-shadow-at-the-observation-deck>The Shadow at the Observation Deck</h3><p>Visitors flock to the observation decks of the Empire State Building for breathtaking views of Manhattan and beyond. Yet, not everyone who visits is truly alive—at least, according to some witnesses.</p><p>It usually starts the same way. Tourists notice a figure standing a little too close to the edge, gazing out over the skyline. The figure—a tall man, often described as wearing a hat or coat—seems out of place. Not because of his antiquated clothing, but because he doesn’t move. He doesn’t take selfies, glance down at a phone, or even seem aware of those around him.</p><p>It isn’t until someone glances back or tries to get closer that they realize the figure is gone.</p><p>In some stories, this apparition has been described as disappearing mid-step or drifting off into the city skyline itself, as though the boundary between his world and ours is paper-thin. Nobody knows who the Shadow at the Observation Deck truly is, but he remains one of the building’s more enduring mysteries.</p><hr><h3 id=a-heartbeat-beneath-the-steel>A Heartbeat Beneath the Steel</h3><p>Strangely enough, not all ghosts in the Empire State Building are human.</p><p>Some nights, when the air is still and the bustle of the city below dims ever so slightly, faint rhythmic thumping has been heard by the maintenance crew. It’s subtle, often dismissed as just the building settling or the hum of machinery. But those who know better refer to it as “the heartbeat”—a deep, resonant sound coming from somewhere within the building’s core. Paranormal enthusiasts speculate it could be related to the intense energy and emotion poured into the building’s creation, the pulse of thousands of workers dreaming of a better life as they built it.</p><p>Whatever it might be, the heartbeat is always there, a spectral reminder that the Empire State Building is more than just glass, steel, and stone. It’s alive—not in the way a person is alive, but in the way a place can hold onto the emotions, stories, and souls of those who’ve passed through it.</p><hr><h3 id=endless-mysteries>Endless Mysteries</h3><p>For so many, the Empire State Building is simply a marvel of modern engineering—a tourist hotspot, a cultural icon, and proof of human ingenuity. But for others, it’s a place layered with unseen realms, where the past converges with the present in fleeting glimpses of something more. Whether it’s the Woman in the Elevator, the spectral construction workers of the 33rd floor, or the Shadow at the Observation Deck, the ghosts of the Empire State Building remind us that even the grandest structures cannot escape the weight of their history.</p><p>Should you find yourself wandering the hushed halls of the Empire State Building at twilight, you might feel it—an electric tingle in the air, the fleeting scent of perfume that doesn’t belong to anyone within sight, the inexplicable sense of being watched. Whatever you experience, rest assured: you are not alone.</p><p>Not really.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/iconic-buildings/>Iconic Buildings</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-ghosts-of-big-ben-midnight-in-london/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Ghosts of Big Ben: Midnight in London</span>
