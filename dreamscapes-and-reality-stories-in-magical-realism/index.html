But it wasn’t like any other mirror, as mirrors usually go. This one wasn’t framed in ornate gold or silver, nor did it have an elegant sheen to its surface. It was a simple thing, rectangular, slightly warped at the edges, and had been hanging on the wall of the old house for as long as anyone could remember. The house was an ancient relic, its walls thick with the stories of the people who had lived within its creaking rooms, each corner a whispered secret of the past.</p><p>Marta had inherited the house from her grandmother, an eccentric woman known for collecting oddities and storing them in drawers and cupboards, much like the rest of her life—secretive, enigmatic, and full of things that made no sense. The house sat on the edge of a small town, bordered by woods that were rumored to harbor strange things, things that only the brave or foolish would venture to seek.</p><p>One day, as Marta dusted off the mantle in the living room, her eyes lingered on the mirror. It had always been there, but today it felt&mldr; different. The usual grayness in the reflection, the familiar contours of the old furniture, and the slight distortion of her own figure—today they seemed more pronounced, more vivid. The edges of the mirror rippled like the surface of water disturbed by a breeze. And then, just as her hand hovered above the glass, she saw it.</p><p>A figure.</p><p>It wasn’t hers, at least not entirely. The woman in the reflection was different—taller, with long, flowing hair and eyes that shimmered like the depths of the ocean. Marta’s heart skipped a beat. She stepped back, her breath catching in her throat, and the image in the mirror followed her movements, as though it were alive.</p><p>“Marta,” the figure said softly, its voice a lilting echo that filled the room.</p><p>Marta’s hands trembled, but she couldn’t look away. “Who are you?” she whispered.</p><p>The figure smiled, an expression that was both familiar and foreign. “I am you,” the reflection said. “But not yet.”</p><p>Marta’s mind spun. The voice in the mirror was her own, but she didn’t recognize the woman before her. “Not yet?” she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.</p><p>The figure nodded. “You will understand, in time. The boundaries between this world and the other are thin. The veil is torn, and you stand at the edge of both. Soon, the dream will merge with reality, and you will know what it means to truly see.”</p><p>The mirror rippled again, and the figure’s face blurred, like smoke dissipating in the wind. Marta took a step back, her heart pounding in her chest. The reflection returned to its usual dullness, and she could see only her own tired, confused face staring back at her.</p><hr><h3 id=the-forgotten-garden>The Forgotten Garden</h3><p>Marta couldn’t shake the feeling that something had changed, but she didn’t know how to explain it. Over the following days, she began to notice small shifts in her world, things that were out of place, as though reality itself was folding in on itself.</p><p>It began with the garden. Her grandmother had always kept a small, overgrown patch behind the house, filled with flowers that bloomed in chaotic patterns. Marta had never paid much attention to it—after all, it was just a garden. But one morning, as she walked past the window, she saw something strange. A single red flower had appeared in the center of the garden, its petals large and glossy, glowing softly in the early morning light.</p><p>Curious, Marta went outside. The air was thick with the scent of the garden, the flowers humming with an energy she couldn’t place. She knelt down to inspect the flower, but when her fingers brushed its petals, the entire garden seemed to shift. The ground beneath her feet trembled, and the world around her blurred. She stood up quickly, but the moment her feet left the earth, the scene before her changed.</p><p>She was no longer in her grandmother’s garden, but in a vast, open field. The sky stretched endlessly above her, swirling in hues of violet and gold, as if it were a painting coming to life. The air was warm, and a soft breeze carried the scent of distant flowers. But what caught her attention was the figure standing at the edge of the field.</p><p>It was the woman from the mirror.</p><p>The woman smiled at Marta, and for a moment, everything in the world seemed to stand still. Marta’s heart skipped in her chest. “Where am I?” she asked, her voice trembling.</p><p>“This is the place where dreams and reality meet,” the woman said. “This is where you will find the answers you seek.”</p><p>Marta felt a surge of confusion and fear. “I don’t understand. What do you mean?”</p><p>The woman’s gaze softened. “You’re standing at the threshold. You have lived your life in the world of waking, but now the dream is calling you. The garden, the mirror, the fields—all of these are the spaces where the two worlds touch. You can step through if you wish, but be warned: once you cross, you may never return.”</p><hr><h3 id=the-choice>The Choice</h3><p>Marta’s mind raced. What was the woman saying? Step through? Was it a metaphor, or was she talking about something real? The woman in the field seemed to shimmer, like a reflection caught in the ripple of a pond. Marta tried to steady her breath, but her thoughts were a whirlwind.</p><p>“What happens if I stay?” Marta asked, her voice small.</p><p>“You will be bound by the laws of the waking world,” the woman replied. “The rules will govern your life, and you will never know what lies beyond. You will never understand the truth of what you are capable of.”</p><p>Marta’s gaze flickered to the horizon. The air was warm, and the fields stretched on forever, a place where time seemed to flow differently. The woman’s words echoed in her mind, mingling with the strange sensation that something was calling to her. It wasn’t just the dream world; it was something more, something she could almost touch, but never fully grasp.</p><p>“What is it I’m supposed to find?” Marta whispered, feeling a deep ache in her chest, an emptiness that had been there for as long as she could remember.</p><p>“You must find your heart’s true desire,” the woman said, “and only then will you understand who you truly are.”</p><p>Marta looked down at her hands, feeling the weight of her decision pressing down on her. She had always lived a life governed by routine, by the expectations of others, by what was real. But now, standing in this strange, surreal place, she felt the pull of something beyond the boundaries of the physical world. Something that whispered to her, calling her to step into the unknown.</p><p>The wind shifted, and the field seemed to stretch further, offering a glimpse of what lay beyond. But at that moment, Marta knew what she had to do.</p><p>With a final glance at the woman, she took a deep breath and stepped forward, crossing the threshold between the two worlds.</p><p>The moment her foot touched the ground, everything around her blurred. The world spun in a kaleidoscope of color and sensation, and she felt as though she were being pulled through time and space. The air grew thick, and the dreamscapes and reality swirled together, merging into one.</p><p>When the world finally settled, Marta opened her eyes. She was no longer in the field or in her grandmother’s garden, but in a place that felt both familiar and new. The sky above her was painted with shades of blue and gold, and the air was filled with the scent of flowers she had never seen before.</p><p>Before her stood a path, winding through an ancient forest. She could hear the distant sound of birdsong, the rustle of leaves in the wind. And at the end of the path, there was a door. The door was made of silver and wood, intricately carved with symbols she couldn’t understand, yet felt as though they were calling her.</p><p>Marta stepped forward, her heart racing. This was the moment, the choice that would define everything. She reached out and touched the door, feeling its cool surface against her skin.</p><p>And in that moment, she understood. Reality and dream were not separate; they were intertwined, threads of a tapestry that made up the whole of existence. The door was the way forward, not just into another world, but into herself.</p><p>With a final, steady breath, she turned the handle and stepped through.</p><p>And the door closed behind her.</p><hr><h3 id=epilogue>Epilogue</h3><p>Marta’s house stood in the small town, as it had always done. The garden behind it bloomed with flowers that had never been seen before, their colors vibrant and alive. The mirror on the wall reflected the room, but this time, it wasn’t empty. It was filled with a light that seemed to pulse with the rhythm of a heart long forgotten.</p><p>And in the depths of the reflection, if one looked closely enough, they might just see her—a woman with long, flowing hair and eyes that shimmered like the depths of the ocean, standing at the threshold between dream and reality.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/magical-realism/>Magical Realism</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/dreamscapes-and-reality-magical-realism-stories-to-read/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Dreamscapes and Reality: Magical Realism Stories to Read</span>
