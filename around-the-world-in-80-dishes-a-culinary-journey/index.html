Her finger darted across continents, pausing momentarily over cities whose names lured her with the irresistible promise of adventure: Marrakech, Osaka, Lima, Mumbai, Lisbon. She sighed, glancing at a battered passport wedged between her cookbooks and a box of questionable saffron. The world was vast, and her appetite, it seemed, was vaster.</p><p>Yet airlines and mortgages had tongues far sharper than her paring knife. Traveling the real globe would not do. But perhaps, she thought, she could taste it instead.</p><p>An idea—both wild and, as she would admit years later, mildly obsessively deranged—took root. She scribbled furiously in a stained notebook: “Around the World in 80 Dishes.” One dish from 80 countries. One kitchen. No shortcuts. No repeats. All homemade.</p><h3 id=chapter-1-mapping-the-menu>Chapter 1: Mapping the Menu</h3><p>Mina’s first challenge was building a list that honored both the globe’s grand stories and its overlooked whispers. Her friends filled her inbox with suggestions.</p><p>“You have to do Italian lasagna!” said Sandro, her Neapolitan neighbor.</p><p>“Mole poblano from Puebla, trust me!” begged her old university roommate, Carmen.</p><p>“Borscht,” declared Anatoly, the melancholy bartender downstairs. “Deep like Russian soul.”</p><p>As the list grew, Mina marveled at the world’s edible diversity. Each dish, each recipe, told a unique story, braided through centuries. From the delicate tang of Vietnamese pho, simmered with star anise and ginger, to the exuberant punch of Nigerian jollof rice, she built a menu—a mosaic of flavor and culture.</p><p>Supplies, she learned, would be a quest in themselves. She prowled the Marché des Enfants Rouges for Turkish pomegranate molasses, navigated labyrinthine Asian supermarkets in Belleville, traded with Ethiopian ladies for berbere, and even accepted a shrink-wrapped hunk of Colombian panela from a friend’s suitcase.</p><p>Her kitchen became an atlas—the walls curling with maps, strings of dried chilis draped over doorknobs, and a scatter of scribbled recipes clustered like continents on her corkboard.</p><h3 id=chapter-2-fires-from-across-the-globe>Chapter 2: Fires from Across the Globe</h3><p>Her first dish was Moroccan: a tagine of lamb, cooked slowly until the meat yielded to the back of a spoon, the air thick with cinnamon and apricot. Jamel, her Moroccan grocer, tasted it and promptly asked if she’d like to marry his cousin. That night, Mina danced through her apartment, spoon in hand, giddy at the realization: she could make the world come to her.</p><p>Each evening brought a new chapter. She battled the curry leaves in Sri Lankan fish ambul thiyal, her fingertips stained yellow by turmeric. She hunched over dumpling dough for Polish pierogi, filling each with potato and cheese. Her French landlords, the Dubois, sniffed hopefully each night, inquiring “What country tonight?” before offering unsolicited advice.</p><p>Cooking, she discovered, was as much negotiation as art. Ingredients often frustrated her: the Croatian dried figs arrived moldy, she burnt the first batch of Egyptian molokhia to a gluey paste, and the dough for her Brazilian pão de queijo refused, for three attempts, to puff.</p><p>But Mina learned. Flaked fish for Bangladeshi bhuna khichuri needed patience, Burmese la phet thoke required hands dyed with tea leaves, and Brazilian feijoada demanded unapologetic amounts of pork and black beans.</p><p>And she learned something else—each dish was more than the sum of its flavors. In the slow caramelizing of Vietnamese banh xeo batter, the pungent slap of Filipino bagoong sautéed for kare-kare, she tasted the persistence of people who kept their gastronomic histories alive through migration, struggle, and celebration.</p><h3 id=chapter-3-gathering-the-guests>Chapter 3: Gathering the Guests</h3><p>It wasn’t long before her culinary journey attracted company. At first it was just friends—willing guinea pigs, happy to trade stories for bites. Then came neighbors drawn by the aromas curling through the stairwell. Word spread beyond the building, and soon on Friday nights, her tiny salon overflowed with an assortment of humanity: students eager for the comfort of their mothers’ dishes, homesick expats, and raucous Parisians always ready for a novel amuse-bouche.</p><p>On Greek night, the heady sizzle of moussaka mingled with laughter and clinking ouzo. A Senegalese griot stopped by to share tales of Dakar before Mina ladled out thieboudienne. Cookbook editors, Instagrammers, and the occasional lonely diplomat crowded the table—each supper a passport, each story a new stamp.</p><p>The meals were not always perfect. The Japanese takoyaki balls collapsed during a boisterous argument over the best udon broth. Mexican pozole took hours longer than planned because someone forgot to soak the hominy. Mina’s Caribbean callaloo—an attempt to reassure a Trinidadian violinist after a messy breakup—was so spicy it reduced half the table to tears and laughter.</p><p>Yet flaws made the journey sweeter. Svetlana declared, “A real meal leaves a stain!” and everyone agreed. Mina’s kitchen was now a tapestry of spilled wine, burnt edges, and muddled accents floating between languages.</p><h3 id=chapter-4-lessons-from-a-spoon>Chapter 4: Lessons from a Spoon</h3><p>By the 40th dish, Mina’s diary had morphed from shopping lists into an archive of reflection. She saw how recipes evolved, transformed by ocean crossings and border skirmishes. Swedish gravlax with its gentle dill, she noted, became something entirely different in Canada—with sugar and cedar smoke in the air. South African bobotie owed its existence to the tangled swirl of Malay, Dutch, and Cape histories—a reminder that cuisine, like identity, was woven from many hands.</p><p>Some lessons came from failure. The first time she attempted Malaysian laksa, the soup split, oil slicking atop the bowl with a stubborn sheen. Disheartened, she called her friend Syaza, who joked, “First step to great laksa: fail three times, then ask your mother.”</p><p>She learned to research, to taste, to listen. She discovered culinary truths not taught in cookbooks: why Lebanese tabbouleh should shimmer with parsley, how Chinese xiaolongbao are best eaten with a splash of black vinegar, and the way Colombian ajiaco draws its soul from three kinds of potato and a whisper of guasca herb.</p><p>Cooking, Mina realized, blurred all categories—sweet with sour, friend with stranger, history with present, home with abroad.</p><h3 id=chapter-5-final-course>Chapter 5: Final Course</h3><p>As the 80th dish neared, anticipation crackled through her community. People voted on the last recipe—should it be something grand, like French bouillabaisse? Or humble, like Syrian kibbeh?</p><p>A Brazilian musician argued for feijoada, a Ghanaian writer lobbied for waakye. But Mina had other plans. For her, the journey had made one lesson clear: a meal is best when it brings people together, each flavor distinct yet harmonious.</p><p>So she decided on Indonesian nasi tumpeng—a cone of golden rice surrounded by small, diverse sides. Eggs, vegetables, chicken, fish—the very spirit of community encoded in rice. As Mina served the sprawling platter, she asked each guest to pick a side, to taste, to share, to tell a story of their home.</p><p>83 people turned up that night, balancing on windowsills, pressed into corners, eager and hungry. Bottles of arak and limoncello were passed. As dishes emptied, laughter and languages swelled together, overlapping in a beautiful confusion.</p><h3 id=epilogue-new-maps>Epilogue: New Maps</h3><p>Mina’s journey did not end with the last dish. The world, she realized, was too wide. Her tiny kitchen, once silent, now bustled every weekend, a portal where the globe shrank to the size of a table. People visited from every arrondissement, sometimes for food, often for the belonging.</p><p>Her notebook swelled with well-loved recipes—Bangladeshi korma, Israeli shakshuka, Peruvian ceviche—each a breadcrumb along a path to connection.</p><p>The real triumph was not culinary prowess, but proof that the journey—measured in stained aprons, new friendships, and the untranslatable taste of home—was worth far more than any stamp in a passport.</p><p>Each meal, Mina whispered to herself as she folded the globe away at night, was a love letter to the world. And with every dish, her community answered.</p><hr><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong><br>If you find yourself hungry for adventure, let your kitchen be your first destination.
