It was the first day of spring, and the farm was stirring to life around me. The dewy grass sparkled in the growing light, and the air was filled with the sweet scent of blooming apple trees. It was a moment of pure joy, and I felt grateful to be living my dream on this small farm in rural Vermont.
The Early Days of Spring
As I took my first sip of coffee, I gazed out at the landscape before me. The snow was melting, and the fields were beginning to transform from barren winter to vibrant green. It was a time of renewal, and I felt a sense of excitement and possibility. This was the moment I had been waiting for – the chance to plant seeds, tend crops, and nurture the land back to health.
One of the first tasks on my agenda was to divide and replant the garlic. Last fall, I had harvested a bounty of scapes and now it was time to prepare the bulbs for their annual growing cycle. I carefully dug up the cloves, spreading them out on a wire rack to dry and cure. The pungent aroma filled the air, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of pride knowing that this field would soon be teeming with life.
As I worked, I heard the usual spring welcomes from the resident creatures. A chorus of birdsong echoed across the meadow, punctuated by the distant moo of the cows in the nearby pasture. Even the chickens were clucking good mornings to one another, as if acknowledging the new season and all its potential.
April and the Awakening of the Pastures
With the garlic underway, I turned my attention to the fields that needed to be turned – literally and figuratively. The perennial flowers I had planted last fall had seen nothing of the attended care they required and the native grasses needed to be finger-metalled on down. It's one of the most basic needs a biennial garden requires, lest it quickly turns overgrown.

April and the Awakening of the Pastures
As the sun climbed higher in the sky, I couldn't help but notice the changes taking place all around me. The once-barren fields were now bursting with new life, and the air was filled with the sweet scent of blooming wildflowers. It was a truly magical moment, and I felt grateful to be a part of it.
I spent the morning working in the garden, planting new seeds and tending to the existing crops. The garlic was doing beautifully, and the lettuce and spinach were already starting to sprout. It was going to be a great year for produce.
As the day wore on, I took a break to tend to the animals. The chickens were happy and healthy, pecking at the ground and clucking contentedly as I made my way around the coop. The cows were also doing well, munching on fresh grass and producing a steady supply of milk.
May: The Birth of New Life
May arrived with a vengeance, bringing with it warm weather and steady rainfall. The garden was thriving, and I was busy tending to the crops, watering, pruning, and harvesting. It was a busy time, but I wouldn't have had it any other way.
The flowers in the meadow were also blooming, and the colors were breathtaking. The red poppies, blue cornflower, and yellow dandelions created a stunning display of color, and I spent hours simply walking through the meadow, taking it all in.
