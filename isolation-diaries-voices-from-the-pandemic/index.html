My seven-hundred-square-foot apartment now feels like it’s shrinking. I pace. The news rumbles in the background—cases rising, graphs climbing. All day, I try to work but drift to the window, searching for a trace of normality. The bar across the street is shuttered, streets hushed except for the occasional masked dog walker. I never noticed the absence of voices before. Now, the silence has weight.<br>I start this diary to keep hold of the days, before they blur into one endless coil.</p><hr><h3 id=april-2-2020>April 2, 2020</h3><p><strong>Carter | Vancouver, BC</strong></p><p>Quarantine is like a science fiction movie. I wake every morning half-expecting a film crew to say cut. I’m a bartender, or was—I lost shifts before they closed the doors. Now, I rearrange my whisky bottles, surf for jobs that might not come back.<br>Today, I called my grandmother in Montreal. She says the city is still, snow melting outside her window. “We’ll see each other after all this passes,” she tells me. Phone calls, video chats, Facebook messages—my life is filtered through glass screens now. I never realized how much I needed a handshake, a hug, the warmth of laughter in a crowded room.</p><hr><h3 id=april-16-2020>April 16, 2020</h3><p><strong>Mona | Mumbai, India</strong></p><p>The mosque’s call to prayer echoes over empty streets. Not even rickshaws clog the narrow alleyways anymore. Some days, the silence aches in my gums, a reminder that habits and hustle have paused.<br>I teach third grade online. My students appear as pixelated faces. Their voices crackle: “Miss, you’re blurry!” Their parents hover in the background.<br>Between lessons, I write poems. One about rain, one about the longing for sunlit kitchens and mangoes piling up at the market. My brother plays guitar softly. We are two islands, marooned together, learning each other&rsquo;s currents.</p><hr><h3 id=may-8-2020>May 8, 2020</h3><p><strong>Andrés | Madrid, Spain</strong></p><p>I take walks at dusk, between curfews. The air is thick with wisteria and disinfectant. Neighbors clap from balconies for the healthcare heroes—I join in, though I don’t know their names.<br>My mother, who lives three floors below, insists on calling from her apartment. “Don’t risk it,” she cautions. Instead, we share dinners over video. She likes to show me her meals, still garnished as if guests might arrive any minute: tortilla de patatas, gazpacho, a perfect flan.<br>Some nights, I write letters to myself, tracing my own loneliness like a cartographer mapping unfamiliar terrain.</p><hr><h3 id=may-29-2020>May 29, 2020</h3><p><strong>Samira | Johannesburg, South Africa</strong></p><p>Day sixty of staying home. The garden is unruly with autumn leaves. My daughter and I build a fort from kitchen chairs and sheets, pretending to be explorers.<br>“Where would you go, if you could?” she asks.<br>“Anywhere with friends,” I say a little too quickly. Later, I hear her telling her stuffed monkey, “It’s okay, Mama’s just sad.” She offers me tea in a plastic cup.<br>When she sleeps, I scroll stories from across the globe. I find comfort in the patterns—fear, boredom, small joys—shared by strangers.</p><hr><h3 id=june-15-2020>June 15, 2020</h3><p><strong>Devin | Wellington, New Zealand</strong></p><p>Cafés reopen, cautiously. People spill into parks in clusters, breathing in the first breaths of communal life.<br>Outside, old men play chess again, hands darting at the board as if time itself is desperate to catch up. I meet a friend for takeaway coffee, sitting two meters apart.<br>“How are you holding up?” he asks.<br>“I made a spreadsheet for everything I lost. Planned a party for the future.”<br>We laugh, and I feel it—hope, tentative but real, like saplings pressing through cracked pavement. The world is changed, but it’s still spinning.</p><hr><h3 id=june-18-2020>June 18, 2020</h3><p><strong>Theresa | Rome, Italy</strong></p><p>My grandmother died today, not of the virus, but alone, the way so many do now. The priest livestreams a Mass. There is no procession, only digital prayers and pixelated candles.<br>I light a real candle on my balcony, whispering goodbye.<br>Street musicians rehearse in the courtyard, their music rising up old stone walls. Someone shouts, “Bravo!”—a fragile normalcy in an altered world. I write my grandmother’s favorite recipe in my diary, promising myself I’ll bake bread and invite friends when I can.</p><hr><h3 id=july-4-2020>July 4, 2020</h3><p><strong>Yusuf | Cairo, Egypt</strong></p><p>Ramadan passed quietly. Eid was smaller—no feasts, no hugs from neighbors. I prayed alone, recited old poems to myself at night.<br>Shopkeepers complain, but masks remain. My brother, a doctor, hasn’t come home in weeks. I send him pictures of the city at sunset, minarets sharpening against orange sky.<br>He replies, “Next year, we’ll eat together.” I believe him, mostly.<br>Sometimes hope is an act of stubborn faith.</p><hr><h3 id=august-1-2020>August 1, 2020</h3><p><strong>Rachel | Chicago, IL</strong></p><p>Summer stretches, restless and hot. Protests march through the city. My work as a journalist pulls me outside—masked, anxious, watching history unfold.<br>In quieter moments, I interview residents navigating isolation. An ER nurse cries behind her mask. A teenager learns to bake to soothe panic. A retired teacher writes daily postcards to lonely neighbors.<br>I gather these stories, redrafting them late into the night. We are separated, but our voices are a bridge.</p><hr><h3 id=august-24-2020>August 24, 2020</h3><p><strong>Ha-Jun | Seoul, South Korea</strong></p><p>Masks have become part of fashion—cats, superheroes, subtle patterns. I livestream violin lessons to students, encouraging them to practice solos. The city is cautious, but not still; deliveries move in a silent ballet along the streets.<br>Some nights, my friends and I play online games, our voices laughing through headphones, bridging the kilometers.<br>I keep a list of simple joys: hot coffee, clean sheets, my mother’s kimchi stew, rain against the window.</p><hr><h3 id=september-17-2020>September 17, 2020</h3><p><strong>Lainey | Dublin, Ireland</strong></p><p>Distant relatives call from Boston, Toronto, Sydney—comparing case numbers, swapping tips for meals and Netflix-binge recommendations. I assemble puzzles, tend my windowsill herbs, and sing in the shower as if the world is my stage.<br>The city has grown accustomed to quiet. Sometimes, the only noise is a distant ambulance or a neighbor’s dog barking at invisible cats.<br>Today, I delivered groceries to Mrs. Murphy downstairs. She waved from behind the door, a grateful blur through frosted glass. Small connections, steady as heartbeat.</p><hr><h3 id=october-9-2020>October 9, 2020</h3><p><strong>Kwame | Accra, Ghana</strong></p><p>My university held classes on WhatsApp until the internet failed. I read textbooks under a mango tree, jotting equations in the margins of old newspapers.<br>When night falls, neighbors gather—six feet apart—to share news, play music, and remind each other that we’re not alone. We make jokes, invent games, hang lanterns to chase away the dark.<br>The world feels smaller, but some days that only means the voices carry farther.</p><hr><h3 id=november-12-2020>November 12, 2020</h3><p><strong>Giulia | São Paulo, Brazil</strong></p><p>Beaches are forbidden, but the sound of the ocean drifts through open windows. My grandfather catches the virus and recovers, but the fear lingers.<br>I started painting again—sunflowers on scraps of cardboard, bright swirls to ward away gloom. Neighbors pass along extra bread, fruit, and news. We exchange recipes and stories.<br>Every evening, I climb the stairs to the roof, watching as apartment lights blink on. Each window a separate life, a universe flickering in the dusk.</p><hr><h3 id=december-3-2020>December 3, 2020</h3><p><strong>Marc | Paris, France</strong></p><p>Counting the days was funny at first, now it’s the only way I know the difference between weeks. I journal compulsively, pages full of what I&rsquo;ve cooked, dreamed, missed.<br>Shops open and close, rules changing like weather. Friends argue about conspiracy theories on WhatsApp groups.<br>One thing has stayed: books. I read and reread stories of past pandemics, past upheavals, and find comfort in knowing isolation has always produced both sorrow and creativity.</p><hr><h3 id=january-21-2021>January 21, 2021</h3><p><strong>Lina | Moscow, Russia</strong></p><p>The city never truly empties, even in crisis. People dash beneath gray skies, breath catching in clouds behind scarves.<br>My ballet studio holds rehearsals on Zoom, dancers pirouetting in cramped living rooms, bumping into lamps and cats.<br>We laugh, but we also mourn the stage.<br>Some nights, I look outside and tell myself: the world will twirl again. For now, we keep moving, one plié at a time.</p><hr><h3 id=february-14-2021>February 14, 2021</h3><p><strong>Amal | Istanbul, Turkey</strong></p><p>Winter sits heavy on the Bosphorus. I bake bread to pass the hours, sharing loaves with neighbors who leave thank-you notes at my door.<br>My grandfather tells stories over the phone about life during other hard times—wars, earthquakes, coups—and always, people found a way to connect.<br>Maybe that’s what I’ll remember most: the mosaic of voices, the unexpected warmth stitched into these cold, strange months.</p><hr><h3 id=march-8-2021>March 8, 2021</h3><p><strong>Nina | Brooklyn, NY</strong></p><p>Spring pushes through at last. Cherry blossoms erupt along the avenue. I venture outside, masked, to see the city unfold like a waking animal. The bar reopens its windows; I recognize the bartender even through his mask.<br>People keep their distance, but eyes meet more often. A nod here, a smile there—a silent promise that soon, we’ll return.<br>I flip back through my isolation diary. In each entry, I hear not just my own loneliness, but a world learning to speak more quietly, to cherish the fragile tendrils of hope.</p><hr><h3 id=epilogue>Epilogue:</h3><p>The story of these months isn’t just about solitude; it’s about the resilience of the human spirit in the face of upheaval. Across continents and cultures, people found new ways to connect, to share, and to bear witness. As cities rumbled awake and routines returned, the isolation diaries became a mosaic—each voice a vital thread in the tapestry of survival, longing, and hope. The echoes of these stories remind us that, even apart, we were never truly alone.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/pandemic-stories/>Pandemic Stories</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/isolation-diaries-true-accounts-of-living-through-covid-19/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Isolation Diaries: True Accounts of Living Through COVID-19</span>
