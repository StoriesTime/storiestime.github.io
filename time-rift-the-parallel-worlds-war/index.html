The Sirrani moon hung low, massive and rust red, illuminating shattered city blocks that blurred, then realigned, walls shimmering like waves. Faint blue motes—spacetime cracks—bobbed along the gutters where the last surge of the rift had finished storming reality’s gates.</p><p>She counted nine enemy soldiers shifting between timelines less than a block away, their uniforms flickering—sometimes Sirrani crimson, sometimes the mottled camouflage of Earth’s Resistance Division. Wrong place, wrong clothes, wrong year. This was war, but not the kind her father had prepared her for.</p><p>“Status.” The word hissed from her throatpiece and came back with a triple echo, her own voice doubled by two avatars in parallel outposts. Time splits, time echoes. “Rissa, left flank?”</p><p>Private Rissa Lazen’s face emerged from thin air—overlayed by the neural implant’s augmented reality—her right eye flickering between blue and bloody red, a telltale indicator she was riding thin on stabilizer injections.</p><p>“Two enemy timewalkers north, near the candy stall,” Rissa whispered. “Getting ready to breach another rift…” Her own face grew faint, the connection jittering as a fresh pulse nearly dislodged the implants from their realities.</p><p>“That’s two squads, if we count Captain Mara,” said Sergeant Quinn, kneeling by Elin’s side as he checked his chrono-charged grenades. “Timeline’s getting thin here. I can practically taste old soap on the air.” He grinned, trying for bravado, but Elin saw the burn-marks on his neck. The last timeline merge had salted his skin with fragments from three different years.</p><p>“On my mark.” Elin closed her eyes, syncing the squad’s internal clocks. The world fuzzed at the edges as her pancerinium vest adjusted to keep her in-phase, her heartbeat skipping in three cadences.</p><p>The Time Rift—born from a wounded experiment deep in the Earth Ministry’s science division—had begun as a single pinhole. A spark in the wrong accelerator, shedding particles across the first World. No one believed, at first, what the Sirrani envoy had tried to warn: timelines are not lanes, but rivers that crash apart and then, violently, converge again when dammed.</p><p>Now all the parallel worlds were at war. None could close the breach alone, and few wished to; every leader wished to peek at better worlds, win unwinnable wars, or steal glorious technologies. It began with spies, then armies, then predatory bands who wrenched history itself. Somewhere, someone had snuffed out a king’s candle; somewhere else, an atomic bomb blinked out, never to scorch the soil. Across them all echoed the fracture.</p><p>Elin’s squad had one aim: capture a Sirrani chronotech and close the rift—at least enough to slow the decay of Cause and Effect. Her own sister, years older in one timeline, years younger in another, flickered in and out of memory as the rifts pulsed. If she survived, she’d patch the timeline, plant the beacon, and—if luck and the unstable laws of the multiverse smiled—go home.</p><p>“Grenade!” Rissa called, just as Quinn lobbed his chrono-charge. The air flickered as time slowed mid-arc, the grenade dividing into three, tracing different parabolas across stacked dimensions. Each exploded with a sound like glass melting in water, shattering space, pinning two timewalkers under the curtain of splintered Cause.</p><p>Elin surged forward, rifle firing anti-temporal rounds. Every bullet carried a charge to “anchor” the enemy in one strand, making them as mortal as before the war began. Sirrani soldiers fell, their red uniforms stiffening into ash, eyes stunned at the loss of their shifting powers.</p><p>The rest blinked, merging momentarily with copies of themselves from divergent threads—making them three times as deadly, three times as confused. Quinn’s hand found her shoulder. “They’ve got reinforcements, Captain Mara says pull back!”</p><p>She shook him off, locked on the chronotech. He was running—no, splitting—his body stretching, torso sagging backwards into two other forms, each clad in sleek Sirrani quantum mesh. “There!” Elin cried. “He’s spooling a return!” She raised her gun and fired a burst.</p><p>The chronotech dropped, his generator spinning off his back, emitting arcs of blue and violet light. All around her, the cityscape flickered. Every building warped through manifold eras—some whole, some ruined, others overgrown with impossible blue jungle.</p><p>“Quinn, Rissa—secure the tech. Rissa, stabilize the generator. Quinn, keep the door covered!” Elin barked. They leapt to obey, as trained in all timelines. She moved in, knees flexing through the unreliable street, wishing hard that the Earth-side patch had not failed.</p><p>The Sirrani, face young yet old, gasped, “You—cannot close it. Not all of them, not—” His accent was twisted by timelines; she could hear his mother tongue echo off millions of iterations. “You think your world is only one. Each closure branches more. They will never forgive.”</p><p>“I know what they’ll do,” Elin whispered back, but despite herself she hesitated. The rift behind him pulsed, black and bloody, like an open wound through which stars flickered and died at random. Right through the tear, dinosaurs marched beside hover-tanks; neo-knights rode with ray-guns strapped to bronze plate.</p><p>She reached trembling hands into the quantum generator, her gloves activating the neural sync. Data flowed; so much of it, futures and pasts, loves and deaths, half-known victories. Her mind felt the rending as she twisted dials, following the codes Mara had smuggled via a bullet in yesterday’s letter.</p><p><strong>Stabilize epoch: +24.10.37. Reset nexus. Seal breach.</strong></p><p>The code was simple. Implementing it was not.</p><p>Her helmet display rippled across potential outcomes. Close here, you cut off a thousand worlds that never had war, never suffered famine. Close there, and your sister never joins the Resistance, never writes the letter of warning that saves the world—YOUR world.</p><p>“Pick one, Lieutenant,” Quinn muttered under his breath as Rissa’s voice cried from a thousand possible throats, the distortions tearing her speech. “We haven’t got forever. Not even in here.”</p><p>She punched the code. The machine howled; the Sirrani soldier screamed, melting into three, then two, then none at all, folded away in terrible symmetry. The breach replied with a jet of searing white, erasing the night and day and all times between.</p><hr><p>When Elin awoke amid the remains of city blocks, the world was silent. The Sirrani moon was smaller now—a fragment, forgotten by the sky. Rissa’s hand was on her shoulder, steady, flesh and bone. Quinn emerged from behind a mound of twisted rift-metal. No blue motes danced. No echoes of alternate footsteps; no double-vision unfurling the minds of her history.</p><p>Her implant pinged once: a message from Captain Mara, static-filled but legible. “Timeline dominant. Collapse complete. Many branches lost. Fate, however—uncertain.”</p><p>Elin stood. Her rifle was just a rifle, no longer a relic of a thousand timelines. Her memory ached; pieces missing, faces half-remembered. Of her sister, she recalled only a faint scent of lavender on dry paper.</p><p>“We did it?” Rissa’s voice, fragile but real.</p><p>“We did… something,” Elin replied. The war—the Parallel Worlds War—was over, at least here. Far away, a child screamed, then laughed; a cat bolted through a puddle, casting only a single shadow. The sun, warm and yellow, climbed into the sky, unburdened by the weight of stolen or denied futures.</p><p>“Home?” Quinn stared at her, hope unguarded.</p><p>Elin nodded, though she had no map, no memory of home’s coordinates. With one foot in this world, and the ghosts of a thousand others fading behind her, she began to walk. Around her, the survivors staggered into the open, blinking in the unfamiliar light of a future they would, at last, build together.</p><p>As she moved, Elin resisted the urge to look back. There was only one world now, whole and alone.</p><p>At least, until the next rift.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/science-fiction/>Science Fiction</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/time-rift-the-consequences-of-altering-history/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Time Rift: The Consequences of Altering History</span>
