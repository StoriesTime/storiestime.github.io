In these enclaves, people of all shapes and sizes, origins and abilities found solace in their chosen occupations, be it as smugglers, hustlers, hackers, mercenaries, or even criminals, as long as they kept their wits about them and stayed true to the code of the underworld.</p><p>Alita was a cornerwoman, a skilled hustler entrusted with the responsibility of procuring contraband goods for the residents of Cloak and Daggery Creek. She earned her bones by delivering, as promised, the rarest resources that her clients asked for. Keen on keeping her reputation and relationships intact, Alita went the extra mile to make certain that she&rsquo;d always be able to wink in the world outside her grotto and never have to pant in it.</p><p>On this night, the city pulsed with secrets, and so did Alita. She stood at the precipice of one world and the next, sussing out the underbelly of a specific shack known for its elusive stockpile of—Ian, a slick and inestimable trader, had requested. Alita&rsquo;s eyes locked onto the punchcard for the warehouse&rsquo;s location, a short URL that led to the subterranean universe where some of the most wily dealers and buyers congregated.</p><p>A blip on her radar, the pulsing thud of quick thrills afoot sent Alita&rsquo;s senses spiraling into high alert. She pursed her lips and crossed the wet stones beneath her boots, striding deeper into the wormhole, testing the banter of the air. The night keened at her like a crow, the fantasy sating each of her objectives all the same. Alita had long mastered the game of finding her way around the behinds of dark alleyways, labyrinths, and the ever-so-enchanted fuzz of the marketplace&rsquo;s sharpest operators. No one would get the best of her.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey there, sugar, what&rsquo;ll it be, hmm?&rdquo; called forth a wary figment of the night, her freckled face obscured in partial darkness by the drooping brim of a sagging hat. Alita tried not to let her aggravation show as she eagerly searched for a glimpse of the sought-after ware.</p><p>&ldquo;How about a slip of azuresilk, or maybe that new weapon you&rsquo;ve got on reserve?&rdquo; Alita inquired quietly, proud of her sass. She longed to extract information from the shroud of mystery that swallowed the place.</p><p>&ldquo;Azure? Oh darling, I ain&rsquo;t got. I don&rsquo;t dabble in that thuggish stuff,&rdquo; the truncated figure chuckled, rubbing Alita&rsquo;s proverbial fur the wrong way. &ldquo;But I do have my finger on the pulse of the market, as it were. It so happens I&rsquo;ve got my hands on a set of dazzling items I know you&rsquo;ll love, little honey.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No thanks. No tricks. I take only what I was promised,&rdquo; Alita retorted, her cheeks flush with a hot, burning anger. Her hazel eyes searched the murky, mazelike room for a way out.</p><p>&ldquo;Whoa now, sweetheart. No need for fiery flutters, we&rsquo;re all just trying to survive in this underground world,&rdquo; the hooded dealer placated, taking an inviting step toward Alita. She braced herself for impact, her hand betraying her resolve, clutched tightly around her baton.</p><p>But his next words made her eyes narrow as if through a monocle of scorn, &ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t got the foggy idea what it takes to work these streets!&rdquo;</p><p>Steeling herself, Alita lunged forward with a snarl, the noises of pleasured haggling fading behind her as the essence of the Cloak and Dagger underworld manifested anew. In a flash of shadows and bold strikes, she and the dealer became a representation of the heart and velocity of the underground, each tenaciously gripping the extremities of their world like bony hands grasping for some form of greater purpose.</p><p>A flash of sword strikes, a parry and a thrust, and the warehouse dissolved around them as the speculative glints of greed exchanged between them, bold and feline, evaporating faster than they festered. In an instant, Alita found herself panting on the floor, her hands and knees wet with some nameless fluid that tasted like irony.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, aren&rsquo;t you something else,&rdquo; Alita rasped with a quick spatter of laughter. Tactfully, she gathered her bearings, retrieved her baton, and rose, the darkened room pulsing with a sinister rhythm that illuminated the war. Stuck in the throes of a grey area that would forever torment the inhabitants of the Cloak and Dagger underworld, their lives and the thrilling danger surrounding them loomed like a shadow over their heads. But now was not the time to brood over dark fates. Lives, hearts, and wits tossed in a fury of risky thrills in the darkness; it was what bonded them in the Cloak and Dagger.</p><p>She couldn&rsquo;t afford to lose now, and the dealer seemed to know it.</p><p>&ldquo;You keep pushing, girl, keep jostling for space in this cutthroat city…&rdquo; the hooded figure murmured, a glint of something less than felinity in his eye. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you ever forget that we all serve at the pleasure of the underworld&mldr;&rdquo;</p><p>With those words ringing in her mind, like a last prayer or an eternal curse, Alita retreated into the night, her heart a thrill of dark uncertainty in her chest. She trudged on through the damp, stone-paved streets of Cloak and Dagger, gray and silent. And with each step, Alita felt something slippery and sinister slither its way into her heart, where it would bind itself to the depths of her whispers, and into the secretive, unadulterated pulse of her world—a hidden truth only the inhabitants of Cloak and Dagger could uphold.</p><p>Treading upon the secrets of this world with a newfound awareness, Alita would learn that those who dwell in the dark emerge like chimeras from the shadows, marked by the mysterious code of the underworld that binds them, a secret weapon or worm holing to both the upperworld and the depths they left behind. This code was their heartbeat, and in it lay a wicked rhythm of identity, danger, and one final hope for all those who still desperately clung to their world—in the mysterious and idling pulse of the Cloak and Dagger.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/espionage-and-spies/>Espionage and Spies</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/cloak-and-dagger-stories-from-the-spy-world/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Cloak and Dagger: Stories from the Spy World</span>
