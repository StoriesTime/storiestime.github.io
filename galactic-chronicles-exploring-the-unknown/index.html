Even as they cooled their drives, the exobiologists aboard were already unbelying themselves in a race against time to record before they orbitted too far from the closest point of reach. Its lack of detection programs suggested either an isolationist population, a lack of advanced technology, or that the planet was without sentient life.</p><p>This is the story of how the crew of the <em>Odyssey</em> discovered what awaited on this planet that had been origionally named &lsquo;U962-47G&rsquo; by the odyssey&rsquo;s protocols.</p><h2 id=arrival-prosperine>Arrival: Prosperine</h2><p>Nothing remarkable in their preliminary scans suggested life on Prosperine, however, their latest drone had just sent back stunning images contradicting the deductions made by their earlier findings. Before them was a painting of free-form tree structures, covered in glowing foliage, that looked like something from a fantasy artist&rsquo;s dream.</p><p>As the crew looked closer, they dreamt of rivers flowing soundlessly, and a certain aura of serenity that surrounded the planet. The planet was adorned with buildings created from bioengineered lilies and grandiose mushroom-domed constructions. Fluttering pastel banners decorated the variety of communal mainstreets and vocal artists filled the communal spaces with sounds that matched the colors of the banners. For Prosperine was home to a species that communicatinobed through vibrations, visuals, and pheromones which they called &ldquo;plaits,&rdquo; &ldquo;wefts,&rdquo; and &ldquo;meshes.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=communication-copacetic>Communication Copacetic</h2><p>Communication was copacetic from the start because the crew of the <em>Odyssey</em> were industrial-commercial-grade explorers of the Galactic Federation, skilled at understanding isolated and different cultures, and those that belied non-verbal communication. Thus, their translators flipped multiple linguistic switches, interpreted dance languages and synchronized movements, and unveiled hidden messages planted in the carefully woven glimpses into Prosperine society.</p><p>The alien species was a bit-verse culture, best described as one that functioned like a tapestry of kairspace economy. Rather than random strands in the bit-verse of commerce, each individual on Prosperine held a distinct and finite set of skills or goods such that they controlled a node in the communal fabric of planetary production and compabilité.</p><p>The crew of the <em>Odyssey</em> didn&rsquo;t understand Prosperine at first, Prosperine communicated in a weave of language, in vibrations they felt, visuals they observed, and in chemical trails they smelled — this kept them from ineffective communication attempts. Patterns in their flora, buildings, and the arts conveyed stories which they soon learned to read in their own language.</p><h2 id=revelations-of-prosperine>Revelations of Prosperine</h2><p>The crew discovered Prosperine&rsquo;s lack of a violent history, as well as their government structured on woven agreements rather that enforcement-based laws. Prosperine didn&rsquo;t need a constabulary to maintain order, as their social disputes were resolved locally by the weft of interconnected individuals possessing an unwritten repository of shared knowledge that contained the volatility and more explanations of their dynamic societal system.</p><p>The crew of the <em>Odyssey</em> leaned that Prosperine had been united in a cultural sense for over two millennia, as each community hosted an ancient library of shared writings in calligraphy the size of a human hair that could last for decades. This proved that their society was not only composed of people who understood their need for each other and their long-term strategy for survival, but it showed how that understanding was woven from common strands of needs, wants, and abilities.</p><p>Prosperine&rsquo;s Lauds of Prosperity were not only about their equal or fair distribution of resources but in their allocation according to need as well. In the memory of their oldest member, Prosperine had never experienced a famine or war, but disarray when participants would not work in kairspace and took resources without contributing.</p><p>The crew discovered Prosperine&rsquo;s methods of resource allocation, the vast variety of information centers and databanks called &ldquo;tripodes,&rdquo; and their impressive control over their planetary resources. Every resource was accounted for, the carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, even the tides of the ocean were carefully tallied and rationed to the last bit-verse unit, propagated by their mathematical precision the economic wheels of Prosperine rolled on.</p><h2 id=consequences-and-farewell>Consequences and Farewell</h2><p>Admiring the intricate tapestry of Prosperine presented by their prismatic production known as &ldquo;meshing,&rdquo; the crew prepared to bid farewell. Despite the fascination of Prosperine, the <em>Odyssey</em> had a schedule to keep, reasons to return to the Galactic Federation, the intricately woven patterns of Prosperine urged within them a sense of responsibility.</p><p>As they embarked upon their departure to-colored the light of space blue and left the vibrant atmosphere of Prosperine, the crew of the <em>Odyssey</em> knew a part of them would remain on Prosperine forever in the plait of memory.</p><hr><p>Thus is the tale of how the planet formerly known as U962-47G unraveled its hidden secrets to the explorers of the <em>Odyssey</em>. This story begins with the silent emergence of Prosperine into the stars and the contribution of its weft of far-esoteric wisdom extends infinitely into the details beyond the <em>Odyssey</em>&rsquo;s observational journey, into the chronicles of Prosperine that remain unknown, yet to be explored.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/life-in-space/>Life in Space</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/galactic-adventures-stories-exploring-life-in-space/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Galactic Adventures: Stories Exploring Life in Space</span>
