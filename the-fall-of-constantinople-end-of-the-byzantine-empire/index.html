For centuries, the city had been the epicenter of Christianity, the seat of power, and the beacon of civilization. But now, it was on the brink of collapse. The once-mighty walls, which had withstood countless sieges and invasions, were about to be breached.
The city's defenders, a motley crew of Greek soldiers, Italian mercenaries, and Genoese sailors, had been preparing for this moment for months. They had strengthened the walls, dug trenches, and constructed barriers to impede the Ottoman advance. But Mehmed II was no ordinary conqueror. He had spent years studying the campaigns of Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar, and had developed a deep appreciation for siege warfare.
As the Ottoman forces launched their assault, the defenders scrambled to respond. The city's guards, led by the brave and experienced John Doukas, fought valiantly to hold back the attackers. But the Ottomans were relentless, their cannons and catapults pounding the walls with incessant fire. The Greeks and their allies returned fire with arrows, stones, and eventually, the trebuchet, a massive catapult that hurled heavy projectiles at the enemy lines.
Despite their bravery, the defenders were vastly outnumbered. The Ottoman army, which had been growing in strength for decades, numbered over a hundred thousand soldiers, a colossal force that threatened to engulf the city. The Greeks, on the other hand, had barely eight thousand men at their disposal.
As the siege dragged on, the city's walls began to crumble. The Ottomans exploited the vulnerabilities they had discovered during the initial assault, and a massive breach opened up in the north wall, near the Blachernae Palace. The defenders fought hard to hold the line, but it was a losing battle.
On the fifth day of the siege, May 29, 1453, the Ottomans staged a decisive attack on the walls. Mehmed II led the charge, his horsemen and infantry streaming toward the breach like a dark tide. The defenders poured out of the palace, determined to stop the invaders, but they were vastly outnumbered. The battle was fierce and chaotic, with both sides suffering heavy losses.
In the end, it was not the Ottomans who breached the walls, but the weather. Heavy rainfall turned the muddy fields outside the city walls into quagmires, bogging down the defenders' supply lines and rendering their trebuchets useless. The Ottomans, on the other hand, seemed to thrive in the wet conditions, their shield walls protecting them from the downpour.
As the final blow neared, the city's leaders, Palestinian Patriarch Gennadius Scholarius and John Doukas, gathered in the palace to discuss their strategy. They knew that all was lost, but they vowed to fight on, even if it meant sacrificing their lives to protect their city.
Late in the afternoon of May 29, Mehmed II ordered his troops to prepare for a final assault. The Ottomans, bolstered by their recent gains, marched toward the breach with a sense of confidence and purpose. The defenders, led by John Doukas and his loyal companions, stood ready to give their lives in defense of their city.
In the hours that followed, the struggle was on. The Ottomans poured through the breach, storming the streets and churches of the city. The defenders fought valiantly, but they were vastly outnumbered. One by one, the cities' strongholds fell, until finally, the palace gates swung open, and the invaders poured in.
John Doukas, one of the last defenders, retreated to the cathedral of Hagia Sophia, where he had hoped to find refuge. But even the sacred walls could not protect him. Mehmed II himself led the charge, brandishing a giant imperial standard. The defending reinforcements, who had been holding off against the Ottomans outside, were finally forced to retreat as well.
At 3 pm on May 29, 1453, the Ottoman army stood victorious outside the cathedral. Mehmed II had realized his dream of claiming the throne of the Byzantines for the Ottoman Empire. As news of the fall spread, dhimmis, the conquered, wept and wailed in the once proud streets of the capital.

For days, the Ottoman troops roamed the city, claiming property and plundering whatever lay in their path.
