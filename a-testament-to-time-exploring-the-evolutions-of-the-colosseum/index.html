A testament to time, the monumental amphitheater has survived countless invasions and natural disasters. Now, as it stands crumbling and impressive, the evolution of the Colosseum mirrors the turbulent history of Rome.</p><p>Once a symbol of the might of the Roman Empire, the Colosseum began as a symbol of victory. Emperor Vespasian, along with his sons Titus and Domitian, ordered its construction as an emblem of renewed peace after the smoke and ashes of the First Jewish-Roman War.</p><p>Completed over a period of approximately eight years, it was grander than its competition, the amphitheaters of Pompeii and Fidenae. The Colosseum was strong enough to hold over fifty thousand spectators, sturdy enough to withstand earthquakes, and large enough to house more than a hundred and fifty thousand animals and gladiators.</p><p>The Colosseum quickly became Rome&rsquo;s hub for entertainment, a place where games and stories of victory were told through blood and sweat. As the years went on, the games became more and more brutal. Animals from all realms, from lions and elephants to Nile crocodiles and celebrity dolphins, were thrown into the Collegial stone confines to entertain their fellow Roman citizens.</p><p>However, as Rome grew more and more decadent, the Colosseum began to symbolize something darker. The once-great symbol of the Roman Empire started to parallel the decadence and decline of its people. With every coup, invasion, and betrayal, the Colosseum&rsquo;s stones felt more and more ominous.</p><p>For centuries, the Colosseum continued to bear witness to Rome&rsquo;s changing fortunes. As Rome went through change after change, the amphitheater remained as a silent testament to the capital&rsquo;s vibrant history.</p><p>When Rome was sacked by the Visigoths in 410 AD, the Colosseum&rsquo;s stones shook, but it remained standing, undeterred. In the following years, Rome changed hands many more times, and the Colosseum remained as a sore thumbpost of the city&rsquo;s ever-shifting allegiances.</p><p>As the medieval era dawned, the Colosseum started to change. Instead of echoing with the hooves of wildebeest and the chants of roaring crowds, the mighty amphitheater fell silent. Although the Church tried and failed to turn the arena into a Christian pilgrimage site, it would take the ever shifting tides of war and time to bring the Colosseum back into the light.</p><p>In the early 14th century, war caused the Colosseum to be fortified as a commissary fortress and a papal residence. It was used as a stronghold during pivotal moments in Rome&rsquo;s history, including common and deadly feuds between the Papacy and the Roman Senate.</p><p>As the 18th and 19th centuries approached, Rome blossomed once again, and the Colosseum saw a revival as a destination for tourists. Artists and poets became infatuated with the mysterious, ancient landscape, and in their works, the Colosseum became a testament to Rome&rsquo;s enduring resilience.</p><p>However, it wasn&rsquo;t until the 20th century that the Colosseum became a true monument of preservation. It was declared a national monument and an UNESCO World Heritage Site. For decades, it was protected and maintained by Italy&rsquo;s Ministry of Cultural Heritage until it was partly damaged by a 1980 earthquake.</p><p>Over the years, the Colosseum has become a massive collection of numerous stories, legends, and people – each marking their own Chapter in Rome&rsquo;s epic, unique history.</p><p>Today, we stand at the ramp leading to the Colosseum, surrounded by a thousand memories that have left indelible markings on the mighty stone structure. The Colosseum may be a ruin, but it is ruined in the most magnificent and resplendent way. Its crumbling stones, its broken arches, and its shattered statuary still echo with the sound of the past – a past that was, is, and always will be a testament to time.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/iconic-buildings/>Iconic Buildings</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/a-tale-of-two-towers-the-ambitious-pursuit-of-structural-splendor-between-new-york-and-dubai/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>A Tale of Two Towers: The Ambitious Pursuit of Structural Splendor Between New York and Dubai</span>
