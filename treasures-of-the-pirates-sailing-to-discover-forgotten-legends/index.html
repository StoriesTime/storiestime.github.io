Their given name was &ldquo;La Mano del Matarife,&rdquo; loosely translated in most dialects to &ldquo;The Hand of the Plague,&rdquo; but preferred by the crew as simply &ldquo;The Hand.&rdquo; Among them was a young and chatty lad, Bartholomew Livermore, whose ankle-length coat sleeves concealed a pair of pruned hands, and whose rococo imagination brazened his invariably naively optimistic rations.</p><p>Bartholomew Livermore was at the age of twenty-seven the sole aesthete of the maritime troupe and less ambiguously its only human ventriloquist. Indeed, he frequently provoked murmurs from the crew with his diatribes or sing-songs of the life and works of the 13th-century minstrel poet, Vahache, famous for his ode to the Sleeping Beauty&rsquo;s nuptial slumber. However, his popularity was not lost to his talents as a navigator nor his almost inhumanly accurate memory of sea charts. He could peer through the foggy night, gaze upon the deadliest wraths of storm, and recall the position of Neptune&rsquo;s trident; hence, his bunks were ever laden with maps of the umpteenth isles and coasts.</p><p>Last night, over a crust of hardtack and, in the pythonic darkness of the creaking hull, the captain, a man of actor&rsquo;s charm and patience, presenting him with a seedy bottle of the distillery’s finest from Barbary, unveiled a plan for a new escapade that was—one might surmise—a bit wild, even for Captain Thatch and his motley crew.</p><p>&ldquo;Listen now, Liverbird,&rdquo; began Captain Exquemelin, a deep chuckle released from the briny in his lungs, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a legend that tells of a lost isle where the treasure of Long John Silver himself lies dormant, insomuch that the treasure doubles every year with time. You know well, my friend Bartholomew, that your palms doth echo with forgotten works of lore. Recall, have you not read of it? A sort of cryptic diary in a late antique manuscript, buried in the dusty catacombs of the London Library, resting beside the memoirs of the sister’s Benjamin.&rdquo;</p><p>Bartholomew began to nod eagerly. &ldquo;Expound, Captain,&rdquo; he suspected, while adjusting his beret for the cordite wind that, every seven hours, singed the sails.</p><p>&ldquo;In this tortoise-shell of cramped ink and parchment,&rdquo; Captain Exquemelin went on, &ldquo;lies the key to unlocking the sands guarding this treasure. Concealed within the veins of the manuscript hides an algorithm, in which once realized, leads X coas pedal the East and then Y triangg lost.&rdquo; He smirks unconcernedly, puffing on his pipe. &ldquo;The parchment&rsquo;s only flaw is that I cannot read, my dear Liverbird.&rdquo;</p><p>Chuckling, Bartholomew replied, &ldquo;Well, you know my boss, Captain—words being my only cornerstone—I&rsquo;ll have this tome figured out before we brace the bow for the sun&rsquo;s edge.&rdquo;</p><p>And so, it was there in the suffocating libraries of London&rsquo;s nose-in-the-air scholars and puritanical research centers, where Bartholomew Liverbird&rsquo;s fingers sifted through landmark chronicles, xenophobic indexers, and wizened tomes—where the tide of piratical fantasy held its breath and sweetly released the most enigmatic of riddles: &ldquo;In whose harbor shall I unfurl the black sails and fix my ship?&rdquo;</p><p>The dark and furtive glances of the collegiate librarians didn&rsquo;t induce the ire of the Inquisition upon him collecting dusty copies as he quieted each eerie tome at midnight and hid them under trench coats, in plain sight of the scholars, as he deciphered their legends. Then, in the weeks the clinical initialisms S.R.O.L (Search, Retrieve, Overappropriate Locate) stretched into months, a cool realization struck upon him like the Coke House bells of midday: the key was not simply an object, as all assumed, unworthy and hidden &lsquo;mong the mirrors of the sand dunes, but the map was already spread out before him, unveiled.</p><p>The componente_token version of this narrative would read:</p><p>An engaging, informative and logical flow tale about Bartholomew Liverbird, a pirate ventriloquist and navigator, who sails with the Hand of Plague pirating crew. The story revolves around Liverbird&rsquo;s discovery of a cryptic map in the London Library, which leads to a treasure of Long John Silver on a lost island, unlocking a past full of pirate legends.</p><p>This narrative iterates a clever game is played between Liverbird and Captain Exquemelin, with Liverbird decoding secrets the crew needs to find the treasure. The adventure takes Liverbird into London&rsquo;s research centers and libraries, challenging his knowledge. Eventually, the answer strikes Liverbird - the map was in front of them all along, unveiling a new course to follow. The tale ends on an intriguing note, leaving the reader with a desire to know what happens next.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/hidden-treasures/>Hidden Treasures</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/treasures-in-the-shadows-short-stories-of-hidden-riches/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Treasures in the Shadows: Short Stories of Hidden Riches</span>
