Rora, the eldest, carried the key of earth; Gavriil, the middle, held the key of air, and their younger sister, Cyela, found herself the guardian of an enigmatic element, water. Each of these children had been blessed with an unusual, symbiotic relationship with the world around them. They were the Windborne Trionomy, anthropomorphic avatars bound to the fickle nature of the elements by an ancient rite.</p><p>It was late afternoon, just after the last rays of sunrise had bid adieu to the sky. The autumn winds sighed their way through the valleys and canyons, carrying the scent of damp leaves and impending decay. The Trionomy siblings stood atop Arx Uberis, the highest of the mountainous rescinds, each lost in their own thoughts as they scanned the distant horizon.</p><p>Suddenly, a palpable tension filled the mountain air. The wind carried whispers of a disturbance, like an ominous undertone of the great choral symphony that was nature. At once, Gavriil felt the vibrations deep within his core, his breath caught in the updrafts, while the hairs at Cyela&rsquo;s nape stood on end. In the presence of power, even Rora felt compelled to look at the landscape with peculiar intensity, her fingers curling around the verdant soil she cradled in her palms.</p><p>Just as the elements seemed to converge in the still air, a gust of wind, like a banshee wail, foretold impending change. Leaves and twigs whipped around in furious flight as the harbingers of the mighty tempest rose from the lower slopes of the Tinder Ridge Mountains.</p><p>A rustle of skirts attracted the siblings&rsquo; eyes towards Cyela. Her eyes, as deep as the sea&rsquo;s fathomless abyss, shone with a rising apprehension, the reflection of turbulent hearts and shores.</p><p>&ldquo;As the winds shift, even the mightiest of oaks will sway,&rdquo; Gavriil muttered under his breath, using the old prophetic saying.</p><p>Before he could complete his thought, a sudden, unnerving silence enveloped the mountain range. That deafening silence preceding a thunderous clap of wind, growing louder before it is clearly understood, caused the siblings to exchange uncertain glances. The wind&rsquo;s rushed currents battered against the rocky faces of the mountainsides, uncertain of which path to take.</p><p>The elemental tumult destabilizing nature affected the very ground beneath their feet. The fall of a single leaf spiraled into a dance of chaos, whipped haplessly by the winds. Rora bit her lip as she pondered their repercussions among the earth&rsquo;s quietude, but she remained unwavering in her resolve.</p><p>Cyela gazed into the storm&rsquo;s violent heart, eyes dark with the weight of prophecy. &ldquo;The balance sways,&rdquo; she muttered.</p><p>As if spooked by her words, the wind picked up, the tempest enveloping the sisters and brother like a living thing, shrouding the mountain peak it had decided to call its own. Leaves sang mournfully as the tempest weaved its path through the trees, and the sky&rsquo;s rim employed its blackened palette as the sun struggled to gain the upper hand in its eternal battle with night. It mattered not - the darkness secured its claim on that day, blotting out the remainder of the setting sun.</p><p>It became a game of shadows, with the ferocious winds acting as both predator and prey. Gavriil felt his breath rejoin him as gusts of wind reached out for him, fingers swift to entangle their sinuous ribbons around his being. Through the tumult, he began to weave a song, a melody meant to bend the wind to his will, his fingers dancing through the air like a symphony. The wind calmed as the music took hold.</p><p>As Gavriil tended to the wind, Cyela wove her fingers through the heaving chest of the storm, allowing the water she held within her to wriggle into storm clouds above. The rain adopted the same wild temperament of the winds, yet it also provided a semblance of relief and calm. Cradling the waters with tender loving care in her tender arms, Cyela tamed the beasts, quieting the destructive masses.</p><p>At last, a semblance of order inspired by the will of the Trionomy returned to the sky. But the element of earth remained untouched, unaffected by the wild gales. Rora stood strong, with the ground beneath her trembling from the storm that hadn&rsquo;t touched her domain. The unwavering goddess of the soil, she ensured the roots remained strong and deep, and the trees would stand steadfast in the face of this tempest’s fury.</p><p>It was then that the siblings understood their role in maintaining the balance, divine in their destinies to right the shifting tides of weather and restore harmony to their domain. And when the skies had cleared and the winds had calmed, the Tinder Ridge Mountains bore witness to more than just the power of nature&rsquo;s fury. They had also witnessed the power, the passion, and the protection of the Windborne Trionomy, the children gifted with divine elemental power to protect and guide the earth throughout future storms and shifts.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/climate-change/>Climate Change</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/greenhouse-woes-locked-in-a-concrete-crypt/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Greenhouse Woes: Locked in a Concrete Crypt</span>
