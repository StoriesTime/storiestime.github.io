The house, with its creaky wooden floors and faded wallpaper, had an air of antiquity that both intrigued and unsettled her. But what truly captured her attention was the large, ornate mirror hanging in the hallway—a piece of furniture that seemed as much a part of the house&rsquo;s history as the very walls it adorned.</p><p>From the first time she noticed it, Emily couldn&rsquo;t shake the feeling that something was wrong with that mirror. It wasn’t just that it was old—there was something about it that seemed… <em>alive</em>, as though it breathed, or perhaps, watched her in return. But Emily wasn’t one to succumb to superstition. She dismissed the unsettling thoughts as the product of her imagination, a byproduct of moving into a new place, a place far removed from her former, quieter life.</p><p>Her nightly routine became familiar: dinner alone at the kitchen table, followed by a long bath, and then the occasional glance at the mirror before heading to bed. But every time she looked into its reflective surface, something was different. At first, it was subtle—like a shadow just behind her. She would turn around, expecting to find someone standing there, but there was never anyone. After a while, though, the shadow grew bolder. And one evening, as she gazed into it, something shifted in the reflection—a fleeting figure, pale and indistinct, standing just beyond her.</p><p>Emily spun around, but the hallway was empty. Her heart raced as her eyes shot back to the mirror. The figure had disappeared, but the air felt heavy, like something had been in the room with her. She quickly turned away and hurried to her bedroom, brushing off the incident as nothing more than a trick of the light.</p><p>Yet, as the days wore on, the strange occurrences became more frequent. Each time Emily would pass the mirror, she’d feel a strange sensation, like her reflection wasn’t entirely her own. Her own movements seemed delayed, as though something was watching her, mimicking her every move. She told herself it was all in her head, that the house was just too old, the light too dim.</p><p>One evening, unable to sleep, Emily decided to confront the mirror. She walked down the hall, heart pounding, and stood before the reflective surface, determined to prove to herself that nothing was there. For a long time, she simply stared at her own image, waiting for some sign that it was all in her mind. The seconds stretched into minutes, and just as she was about to turn away, the reflection shifted once again. It wasn’t much, just a subtle movement, but enough to make her blood run cold.</p><p>Her reflection was no longer mimicking her perfectly. There was something else there now—an unmistakable figure, standing just behind her, obscured by shadows. Emily’s breath caught in her throat. She spun around, but there was no one there. She whipped her gaze back to the mirror.</p><p>The figure was gone. But something had changed. The hallway felt darker, colder. And she was no longer alone.</p><p>The air around her seemed to pulse, and the faintest sound—a soft whisper—floated through the room, though there was no one else around to speak. It was a voice, a low, guttural sound that seemed to resonate from within the very mirror itself. Emily couldn’t make out the words, but the tone was unmistakable—full of malice, and something much older than the house itself.</p><p>Panicked, she stumbled backward, her hand brushing against the wall for support. The whispers continued, growing louder, more insistent, as though the mirror was calling to her, urging her to come closer. It was then that Emily noticed something truly horrifying—a name etched into the glass, barely visible, but unmistakable. <em>Ava</em>.</p><p>Her heart stopped. Ava? She didn’t know anyone by that name. And yet, there it was, carved into the mirror, as if it had always been there, waiting for her to see.</p><p>Determined to get to the bottom of this, Emily began to research the house&rsquo;s history. What she uncovered sent a chill down her spine. The house had once belonged to a family—the Winters—who had mysteriously disappeared several decades ago. Rumors had circulated that the family had been involved in some dark rituals, something forbidden, something that had marked the house as cursed.</p><p>Among the files she found a single mention of a young girl named Ava Winters. The story went that Ava had been the youngest of the family, and that she had disappeared without a trace one fateful night. Some believed she had drowned in the nearby creek, while others whispered that she had been claimed by something much darker, something that had come through the mirror.</p><p>The more Emily learned, the more she realized that the mirror was no ordinary object. It wasn’t just a reflection of the world around it—it was a gateway, a window to something beyond. The whispers, the shadows, the name… they were all connected to Ava, and perhaps to something much older, something that had been trapped within the mirror for years.</p><p>One night, unable to resist any longer, Emily stood before the mirror once more. This time, she wasn’t just afraid. She was determined to understand what had been haunting her for so long. She stared at her reflection, her heart pounding in her chest, and whispered, “Ava, are you there?”</p><p>The air grew thick with tension. For a moment, nothing happened. Then, the whispers began again, louder this time, as if they were speaking directly to her. She could hear the words now, distorted and fragmented, but unmistakable. “Help me… trapped… free…”</p><p>Suddenly, the figure appeared again, this time clearer than before. Ava’s face was pale, her eyes hollow and dark. She reached out from the mirror, her hand almost touching Emily’s. The room seemed to warp around them, the walls distorting, the floor bending. Emily’s breath caught in her throat as she stepped forward, her hand trembling as it moved toward the mirror.</p><p>Before she could touch the glass, a cold, unseen force gripped her wrist. The mirror began to shimmer, its surface rippling like water. Ava’s face twisted in anguish, her mouth opening in a silent scream. Emily tried to pull back, but the force was too strong.</p><p>“<em>No</em>!” she shouted, yanking herself free. She stumbled backward, crashing to the floor. The mirror, once still, now seemed to pulse with energy, its surface swirling, as if the very fabric of reality was being torn apart.</p><p>Emily scrambled to her feet and ran from the room, the mirror’s whispers still echoing in her ears. She didn’t stop until she was safely outside, her breath coming in ragged gasps. The house loomed behind her, dark and silent.</p><p>But even as she stood in the yard, the unsettling feeling didn’t leave. She knew, deep in her gut, that the mirror wasn’t finished with her yet. Something had been awakened. And it would come for her again.</p><p>Weeks passed. Emily couldn’t bring herself to go back to the house. She stayed with a friend, and the memories of the mirror and the figure in it began to fade, replaced by the normality of life. But one night, when she thought she had left it all behind, she found herself standing before another mirror—this one in the bathroom of her new apartment.</p><p>Her reflection looked back at her, just as it always had. But as she turned away, she saw something in the corner of the glass—just a glimpse, a fleeting shadow.</p><p>The whispers began again.</p><p>And somewhere, deep in the reflection, a pale, anguished face stared back at her, waiting.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/ghost-stories/>Ghost Stories</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-ghost-in-room-213-real-hotel-haunting/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Ghost in Room 213: Real Hotel Haunting</span>
