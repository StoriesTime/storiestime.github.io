Trees twisted like gnarled fingers reaching up from the earth, their bare branches scraping the sky as if trying to claw their way to freedom. Beneath the canopy, the air was thick with the scent of damp earth, moss, and the faint metallic tang of blood. This was no ordinary forest. It was a hunting ground—a place where both man and beast preyed, and where survival often meant betraying the very ones you trusted most.</p><p>Dorian had been a hunter for as long as he could remember. Not just any hunter, but a master of the craft. With eyes as sharp as a hawk’s and senses honed by years of pursuit, he had made a name for himself in the dark corners of the world. Hunters like him didn’t just track their quarry—they became the very embodiment of fear. They stalked shadows, ambushed with deadly precision, and left no trace behind.</p><p>But tonight, something felt different. The usual thrill of the hunt, that rush of adrenaline, was replaced by an uneasy sensation at the back of his mind. Dorian brushed it off. Fear was a luxury he could no longer afford. The night was his to conquer.</p><p>He tightened his grip on the crossbow strapped to his back and moved forward, his steps silent on the soft forest floor. A rustling in the underbrush caught his attention. A rabbit, perhaps, or a deer. He paused, listening, but then—another sound. A twig snapped, sharp and deliberate, too calculated to be an accident. Someone—or something—was out there.</p><p>His instincts kicked in. Dorian crouched low, blending with the shadows, his eyes scanning the darkened expanse of trees. He was not alone.</p><p>At first, he saw nothing. But then, between the trunks of the towering oaks, he caught the glint of something. A pair of eyes. They shone in the darkness like twin orbs, gleaming with an unnatural hunger. The predator was being hunted.</p><p>Dorian’s heart skipped a beat. He had hunted many creatures, but none like this. The eyes were too intelligent, too full of malice. He could feel the presence of something ancient, something older than the forest itself, lurking just beyond the veil of reality. The air seemed to thicken, the weight of the unseen pressing in on him from all sides.</p><p>Then, with a movement as swift and fluid as a shadow, the creature stepped into view. It was tall—taller than any man, with an unnatural, almost skeletal frame. Its skin was a mottled grey, stretched tight over its bones, and its eyes glowed with an eerie light. But it was the fangs that drew Dorian’s attention. Long, sharp, and gleaming in the moonlight, they seemed to thirst for blood.</p><p>A vampire. But this one was different. It wasn’t just a monster of the night—it was a predator with purpose. Dorian’s hand instinctively went to his blade, but before he could unsheathe it, the creature moved. It was on him in an instant, faster than any human could comprehend.</p><p>Dorian barely had time to react. The vampire’s claws raked across his chest, leaving a trail of blood in their wake. He gritted his teeth, fighting through the pain. He had been in worse situations before, but there was something about this creature that felt&mldr; wrong. It wasn’t just hunting for food—it was hunting for something else.</p><p>“Why?” Dorian spat, blood trickling from his lips. “Why me?”</p><p>The vampire’s lips curled into a grotesque smile. “Because, hunter,” it hissed, “you are not the one doing the hunting tonight.”</p><p>Before Dorian could register what had happened, the creature lunged again, this time sinking its fangs deep into his shoulder. The pain was excruciating, burning like fire as the vampire drained the life from him. Dorian struggled, but his strength was fading fast. The world around him began to blur, his vision dimming as the vampire fed on his essence.</p><p>“You&mldr; can’t&mldr;” he gasped, his body growing weaker with each passing second. “I&mldr; was never&mldr; the prey.”</p><p>The vampire laughed, a low, rasping sound that echoed through the trees. “You were never the predator, either,” it replied, its voice full of disdain. “You were always the tool. The pawn in a much larger game.”</p><p>The vampire’s words sank deep into Dorian’s consciousness, piercing through the fog of pain and fear. Tool. Pawn. He had spent his entire life thinking of himself as the hunter, the one in control. But now, in this moment of vulnerability, the truth was undeniable. He had been used. Manipulated. The predator who had once stalked the night had become the hunted, and in his final moments, he realized he had been a mere player in someone else’s game.</p><p>With one last, desperate breath, Dorian’s vision went dark.</p><hr><p>Dorian awoke in a cold sweat, his body trembling. For a moment, he thought it had all been a nightmare—until he saw the blood-stained leaves around him, the claw marks on his chest, and the unmistakable scent of the vampire’s bite still lingering in the air.</p><p>He was alive, but barely.</p><p>The vampire was gone, but its words haunted him. He had been the prey. And yet, something gnawed at him, something he couldn’t shake. This wasn’t over. No. It couldn’t be.</p><p>With every ounce of strength he had left, Dorian pushed himself to his feet, his hand clutching his chest where the wound had been. The blood was still fresh, the pain sharp, but there was no time to waste. He had to find the vampire. He had to take back control.</p><p>But first, he had to understand. He had been betrayed, yes, but by whom? Who had sent the creature to hunt him? And why? Dorian had spent his life tracking monsters, but now he found himself trapped in a labyrinth of lies, deceit, and manipulation.</p><hr><p>Days passed, but the answers were slow to come. Dorian hunted for the vampire, searching every corner of the forest, but the creature seemed to vanish as quickly as it had appeared. The trail grew cold, and frustration gnawed at him. He knew he couldn’t trust anyone—not even those who had once been his allies. The line between hunter and prey was razor-thin, and he had learned the hard way that no one was above betrayal.</p><p>It wasn’t until he returned to the city that he found the first real clue. A familiar face, a fellow hunter who had once been a friend, greeted him with a grim smile.</p><p>“You’re still alive,” the man said, his tone laced with something Dorian couldn’t quite place. “I didn’t think you would be.”</p><p>Dorian narrowed his eyes. “You knew? You knew what happened to me?”</p><p>The man’s smile faltered, just for a moment. “I had my suspicions. But you know how it goes. Hunters like us—we don’t ask too many questions.”</p><p>Dorian’s heart sank. The pieces were starting to fall into place, but the truth was more twisted than he could have imagined. The vampire had been a tool, sent by someone who had once been his closest ally. The betrayal ran deeper than he thought.</p><p>“Who sent it?” Dorian demanded. “Who set me up?”</p><p>The man’s eyes flickered with fear, and for the first time, Dorian saw the predator within him—an expression that mirrored his own when he had been the hunter. He took a step back, his voice shaking. “You should have stayed away, Dorian. Some things&mldr; some things are better left unknown.”</p><p>It was then that Dorian understood. The world of hunters was not just one of prey and predator—it was a world of power, politics, and shadows. A world where betrayal was a currency, and loyalty was a fleeting illusion.</p><hr><p>The hunt was far from over.</p><p>Dorian knew he had to go deeper, to confront the source of the treachery. The vampire had been just the beginning. There were others, and they would stop at nothing to see him fall.</p><p>But now, Dorian wasn’t just hunting for survival. He was hunting for revenge. The hunter had become the hunted, but in this world of deceit and blood, he would rise again.</p><p>The forest had taught him that no one was untouchable. Not even those who thought they controlled the game.</p><p>And when the final blow fell, Dorian would be the one holding the knife.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/betrayal-and-revenge/>Betrayal and Revenge</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/fangs-of-betrayal-a-dark-revenge-tale/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Fangs of Betrayal: A Dark Revenge Tale</span>
