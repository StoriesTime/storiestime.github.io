In this village, there existed an enchanting community of animals, each with their own unique way of life, and beliefs. The animals led harmonious lives as they went about their day, forming friendships, and holding onto their distinctive customs. Yet, in the deepest corners of this peaceful village, a sinister prejudice brewed amongst the animals.</p><p>The river otters were known to be skilled hunters and swimmers, governing over the vast and pristine river that flowed through the valley. They took pride in their sleek black and silver fur, which shimmered mysteriously in the soft sunlight. While the otters spent most of their time exploring the secrets beneath the waves, they were fiercely protective of their territory, and their swift swimming abilities helped to keep their domain secure against invading forces.</p><p>However, as enticing as the sparkling river was, there was another part of the valley that few animals dared to cross. The towering fibrous trees of the dense forest spoke of dark mystery and an untold tale that few had lived to recount. The forest feared the unseen inhabitants that roamed its treacherous pathways. The whispers of the village spread tales of the strange and unsettling encounters that those who ventured into the thicket endured, and how the treacherous paths seemed to vanish and twist upon themselves. The village of animals seemed content to maintain their distance from the mysterious forest.</p><p>One day, a curious young otter named Ollie wagged his bushy tail and swam to the edge of the river. He gazed at the bizarre shadows cast by the trees along the riverbank and felt a blossoming urge to delvet further than any of his family members had ever ventured. He longed to beat the path to the forest, a place where few of his kind had ever dared to venture.</p><p>Ollie&rsquo;s mother Nelly tried in every way to dissuade him from his course. &ldquo;The forest isn&rsquo;t safe,&rdquo; she warned, &ldquo;Dark, and treacherous, the pathways maintain a sinister secret.&rdquo; Nervously she swam in a circle around her young one.</p><p>Ollie, however, was not a creature to be easily discouraged. He retorted, &ldquo;But mother, what of all the unknown! I wish to explore what lies beyond the bank.&rdquo; The desire was not one he could disregard, and he would not heed her warnings.</p><p>Nelly sighed. It was evident there was little she could do to alter her son&rsquo;s determination. She reluctantly said, &ldquo;Very well, though my heart is heavy with worry. Swim safely, Ollie.&rdquo;</p><p>The next morning, Ollie proclaimed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready to embark on this strange journey!&rdquo; As he dove into the water, he was careful not to expose more of himself than his sleek and streamlined body. He maintained good speed until he reached a river bend that seemed to be reaching in the direction of the forest. With a powerful leap, he pushed toward land.</p><p>On first landfall, Ollie marveled at the unearthly forest before him. The trees twisted unnaturally in the unbranded twilight, evoking the inexplicable. Their limbs reached out into the space as if in an aggressive stance. Shadows concealed the kotow corner of the forest, and the otter&rsquo;s senses shook. This was no realm for the ordinary. Ollie mustered his courage and began his exploration, not bothering to contact his family.</p><p>As he waded further into the forest, the darkness did not dishearten the otter. Instead, he was intrigued by the whispers that accompanied the stillness of the night. He tried to decipher these curious noises, but to no avail. Yet, Ollie forged ahead, urged on by his unquenchable curiosity and lust for exploration.</p><p>One day, as the light of the moon fractured the darkness of the forest, Ollie came across a certain stillness, which indicated the presence of something unusually large. In his astonishment, he halted in his tracks. The sound of lifeless bodies groaning made him flinch. The dry leaves crunched under his steps, which somehow seemed to attract the growling.</p><p>Amid the noise of torment and pain, a mysterious figure emerged from the trees. It was rotund, with heavy-set limbs and sloping shoulders, which bore the strength of a hundred otters. The stranger gazed at Ollie, as though analyzing every element of his being.</p><p>The newcomer uttered a halting, harsh language, which sounded like vowels scraped together and carried on the wind. He seemed indescribably sinister and created a powerful impression on Ollie. The otter stiffened, sensing the dangerous aura that hung around the enormous creature.</p><p>&ldquo;You have ventured far and now find yourself within my domain,&rdquo; the creature croaked, casting a menacing glint in the starlight. &ldquo;This world belongs to the creatures that slumber within these trees. You may be one of the otters, but you swim out of your depths. This is merely a fraction of a lesson on the dangers that lie ahead.&rdquo;</p><p>Ollie gulped but looked the stranger in the eye, his spirit unbroken. &ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; Ollie retorted. He stood his ground, trying to discern the devilish legend that nestled deep within these groves.</p><p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the enigmatic figure, extending one of its vast, intimidating limbs. &ldquo;Your insolence will be your undoing. Here, take this.&rdquo;</p><p>In its grasp, he found an ancient looking stone that seemed to weigh more than he could carry. Nevertheless, Ollie had no choice but to take the stone and hold it. As soon as the stone made contact with his soaked, worked otter fur, Ollie felt himself sinking. Not just into the earth but losing all control of his consciousness.</p><p>The of the neighboring animal villages believed that the Owner of the Stone was a legendary and mythical creature born from the ancient legends of the forest. Few had the courage to claim that it was real, but to those who experienced it directly, like young Ollie, the Stone was all too real. In the cruel hand of the forest’s unknown inhabitants, there was no escape. Ollie had entered the forest not realizing the untold prejudice that awaited him.</p><p>The stone left a curse on him; Ollie was trapped within the magical grip of the mysterious forest inhabitants and forced to serve their sinister purposes. This was a reality far removed from the idyllic life he had known in the river. Forlorn and burdened by guilt, Nelly and the otters of the river had no means to help Ollie or redeem him. The name ‘Owner of the Stone’ became a label so dreaded it overshadowed even the swift swimming abilities of the once-celebrated river otters.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/racism-and-prejudice/>Racism and Prejudice</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/unspoken-a-journey-through-the-lens-of-prejudice/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Unspoken: A Journey Through the Lens of Prejudice</span>
