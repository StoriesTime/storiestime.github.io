There were shards of cerulean, jagged fragments of burnt orange, and edges of inky blackness that shimmered like spilled oil. It was said that the city had once been whole, a place where the sum of its parts made sense. But that was before the Fracture.</p><p>Nobody remembered when the Fracture occurred. Some said it was the rage of long-dead gods, others murmured about experiments gone astray in a past too distant to name. All anyone knew was that the world had splintered—not just matter, but perception itself. The air thrummed with a low vibration, like a machine caught in a stuttering loop, and reality reeled in fragments too sharp to fully grasp.</p><p>Lazaire, a so-called &ldquo;Cartesian Diver&rdquo; specializing in dimensional repairs, walked the streets with care. He had learned to avoid running water. Reflections held their own truths in Mirzane, truths that had a tendency to pull you into them if you stared for too long. He kept his head down as shards of the world glimmered around him—windows reflecting not what lay opposite them, but what had been or what could be.</p><p>His current assignment was a delicate one. A wealthy patron had summoned him to Neviette Heights, the oldest and most shattered district in the city. The patron, a collector of artifacts from before the Fracture, was seeking answers to a problem she wouldn&rsquo;t name outright—something about dreams bleeding into her waking life. Lazaire didn’t need specifics yet; he&rsquo;d seen enough of Neviette to imagine what might be happening. It was a place where time folded in on itself, where memory and intention tangled like snarled yarn. The only guarantee there was uncertainty.</p><p>As he approached her townhouse, Lazaire couldn&rsquo;t ignore the way the building leaned unnaturally inward, as though drawn by some unseen gravity. The wrought-iron gate creaked open reluctantly, and the air grew colder. Shards of broken daylight dripped through the cracks in the clouds above. Each step toward the patron&rsquo;s door felt like walking deeper into a cubist painting, where the angles made sense only if you abandoned all logic.</p><p>The door opened before he could knock, revealing a slight woman with sharp green eyes and a face that seemed to flicker in and out of focus. She introduced herself as Selis Marchand.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Lazaire, the Cartesian, yes?&rdquo; Her voice was clipped, each word precise, as though trying to anchor itself in the fractured world. &ldquo;I trust you’ve dealt with anomalies before?&rdquo;</p><p>He stepped inside, avoiding the swirling pattern on the tiled floor that seemed to shift underfoot. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s what I do. What seems to be the trouble?&rdquo;</p><p>Selis led him to her parlor, a room crammed with artifacts from a world that no longer existed whole: maps with missing continents, clocks with hands that moved counter to time, and crystals that refracted light in unsettling ways. But it wasn’t the collection that drew Lazaire’s focus. It was the mirror above the fireplace.</p><p>The frame was ornate, carved from something that looked like bone but shimmered with an iridescent hue. The glass itself rippled like water, reflecting not the room but an entirely different landscape. In the mirror’s surface, a forest of jagged trees swayed under a blood-red sky.</p><p>&ldquo;It started a month ago,&rdquo; Selis confessed, her sharp gaze fixed on the mirror. &ldquo;I bought it at an auction—it was said to be from Astregal, one of the few cities untouched by the Fracture. But the longer it’s been in my possession, the more&mldr; intrusive it’s become. At first, I couldn’t sleep—dreams of that place haunted me, dreams that felt so vivid they could’ve been memories. Then I started seeing fragments of those dreams while I was awake. Now, I believe it’s trying to pull me in.&rdquo;</p><p>Lazaire crouched in front of the mirror, careful to keep his reflection out of view. The forest within seemed to react to his presence, the trees bending as though leaning closer to examine him. The air in the room grew thicker, and a faint humming filled his ears.</p><p>&ldquo;It’s not just the mirror,&rdquo; Lazaire murmured, tracing the edge of the frame without touching its surface. &ldquo;This artifact is a node. It’s connected to a pocket of reality that wasn’t fully severed from ours during the Fracture. The border is unstable. The more you interact with it, the weaker the veil becomes.&rdquo;</p><p>Selis paled. &ldquo;So what am I supposed to do? Destroy it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That would tear the veil entirely,&rdquo; Lazaire explained. &ldquo;And trust me—you don’t want that pocket reality spilling fully into ours. No, the node has to be neutralized and the connection severed from within.&rdquo;</p><p>She frowned, her hands clasping tightly together. &ldquo;You mean someone has to go&mldr; inside the mirror?&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded. &ldquo;It’s the only way. I’m trained for this. But understand, once I go in, there’s no guarantee I’ll find my way back.&rdquo;</p><p>The humming intensified as Lazaire prepared himself. With a deep breath, he placed his palm flat against the surface of the mirror. It rippled like liquid, enveloping him in its shimmering embrace. The world around him dissolved into sharp-edged fragments, pulling apart and reassembling themselves into the crimson forest he had glimpsed through the glass.</p><p>The air was heavy, metallic, and each breath came with an odd sensation, as though he were inhaling sharp splinters of light. The ground beneath him was uneven, shifting with every step. The trees bent and twisted impossibly, their elongated branches sprouting angular leaves that refracted the red sky.</p><p>Lazaire didn’t feel alone. Shadows moved at the corners of his vision, just shy of recognition. The hum he had heard in the parlor was louder here, pulsating in rhythmic waves. It seemed to be coming from a single point deeper in the forest.</p><p>He followed the sound, each step taking him further from any anchor to the world he knew. Time didn’t flow normally here; seconds stretched into eternity, only to snap back as moments collapsed into a single beat. He could feel the fractured nature of the pocket reality, a space stitched together by forces that barely held.</p><p>At the center of the forest, he found it: a massive obelisk of translucent material, glowing faintly with shifting colors. The hum emanated from deep within it, resonating in his chest. This was the anchor, the heart of this fractured reality. If he wanted to sever the connection, he would have to destabilize it.</p><p>Drawing on his training, Lazaire began weaving the threads of his own reality, creating a tether that would allow him to pull himself back. But as he worked, the shadows circling him grew bolder. They were not creatures in the traditional sense—they were fragments, jagged pieces of existence, echoing voices from a reality that had been unmade.</p><p>They spoke to him in whispers, offering glimpses of memories he had buried long ago, a life before the Fracture. The temptation to linger—to piece together what had been lost—was immense. But Lazaire knew better. Mirzane’s lesson was clear: the past was a reflection, and reflections could consume you.</p><p>With a final pull of the tether, the obelisk shattered. The forest quaked around him, and the red sky fractured into an explosion of light. Lazaire felt himself being pulled backward, through shards of broken dreams and collapsing dimensions.</p><p>He awoke on Selis’s parlor floor, gasping for air. The mirror above the fireplace was still, its surface reflecting only the room around it. The hum was gone.</p><p>&ldquo;It’s done,&rdquo; he said hoarsely, sitting up. &ldquo;The connection is severed. It won’t trouble you anymore.&rdquo;</p><p>Selis looked relieved, though a shadow of doubt lingered in her eyes. &ldquo;And what about you?&rdquo;</p><p>Lazaire smiled faintly. &ldquo;I’m still here&mldr; mostly. But in this city, that’s the best any of us can ask for.&rdquo;</p><p>As he stepped out of the townhouse and back into the fractured streets of Mirzane, his reflection lingered in a windowpane longer than it should have, watching him go.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/artistic-movements/>Artistic Movements</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/cubist-connections-love-and-geometry-in-a-fragmented-world/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Cubist Connections: Love and Geometry in a Fragmented World</span>
