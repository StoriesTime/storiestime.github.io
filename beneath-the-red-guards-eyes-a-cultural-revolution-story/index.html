The silence was thick, oppressive, pressing into her chest until her heartbeat drowned her thoughts. Her hand, still clamped around the stub of white chalk, trembled. She swallowed—the sharp, dry taste of fear lingering on her tongue.</p><p>Outside, four boys, decked in red armbands and rumpled cotton jackets, loitered near the schoolyard gate, their laughter brittle. The slogans painted on the wall behind them—“Destroy the Four Olds!” and “Loyal to the Chairman!”—bled red and uneven, faded in places and ferociously new in others. She could see one of them, Wei Ming, the old class monitor, tossing a book up and down in his hands—a battered volume stripped of its cover. Xiao Lan recognized it, even from this distance. <strong>Selected Poems of Du Fu.</strong> She remembered lending it to her father, remembering the way he handled it, always so gently, as if it were a living thing.</p><p>Footsteps echoed along the corridor. The rhythmic, rubber-soled slap against the worn stone tiles sent a shiver up her spine. Was it her turn? Or were they here for old Teacher Zhang? Lately, it never seemed to stop, this sense of being hunted even when standing still.</p><p>A knock, three times, too loud for courtesy.</p><p>“Lan! Xiao Lan, are you in there?” The voice tried to sound warm, but there was a practiced roughness she’d come to recognize: Yang Jiao, one of the school’s Young Pioneers, eyes always alert for subversion.</p><p>She opened the door, her lips pressed tight.</p><p>“There’s a meeting. You must come,” said Yang Jiao. “All students. All ‘clean’ students.” The implication stung. In their dialect, “clean” meant untainted by “bourgeois” ideas, peasant background, good revolutionary family. The rest—she—were suspect animals, waiting for branding.</p><p>Xiao Lan followed, eyes down, through the echoing halls. They passed the biology lab, its windows smashed months ago, glass replaced with oiled paper that shivered in the wind. In the assembly courtyard, she joined the others—more armbands than students these days, the reds and drab greens like wounds in a sea of fear.</p><p>She listened as the school principal—formerly a matronly fixture, now gaunt, nervous—read the latest names from the list. More families to be ‘interrogated.’ More teachers for ‘struggle sessions.’ Xiao Lan felt the eyes, gauging who flinched, who met the gaze, who wanted to disappear.</p><p>Her own name was not on the list. Not today. But her father’s was.</p><hr><p>When the meeting ended, the sun had dipped below the overgrown wall. Shadows sprawled like spilled ink over the mud path. Xiao Lan found herself at the library, half-closed, but silence more forgiving here. Mrs. Weng, the librarian, hunched behind the counter.</p><p>“Xiao Lan. Why aren’t you at home?”</p><p>“My father—” she started, faltering. How did one explain the surge of humiliation and terror when a parent’s name joined that list? Mrs. Weng’s lips thinned, but she nodded, and turned away.</p><p>Every familiar space was infected, she thought, as she wandered between the shelves. Books wrapped in brown paper lined the lowest racks, old editions hidden under chemistry textbooks and Marxist pamphlets. The shelves she used to frequent—the poets, history, foreign fiction—were half-empty now, remnants of a world deemed poisonous.</p><p>She found a battered novel, <em>The Family</em> by Ba Jin, behind a stack of propaganda leaflets. It should have been confiscated. She felt the risk pulse beneath her tongue. The book’s spine was worn and soft, familiar.</p><p>A sound—a footstep? A cough?—startled her. She stuffed the book under her coat.</p><hr><p>On her way home, she walked the back alleys, avoiding the main road patrolled by young Red Guards. She spotted a crowd outside the community hall. At first she thought it was the usual struggle session, but the shouts were more animal than human, mixed with desperate pleading. She gripped the book tighter, her mouth gone dry.</p><p>Inside, lantern light flickered on the pale, terrified faces of the accused. Xiao Lan saw her father among them, flanked by two Red Guards. His tweed jacket was torn, his hair askew. He stood straight, refusing to bow his head.</p><p>Wei Ming, the former class monitor, stepped forward holding a placard: “Counterrevolutionary—Zhang Heng,” her father’s name scrawled in black.</p><p>The shouts rose: “Down with the Rightists! Denounce the bad elements!” The crowd surged, fists raised. Xiao Lan tried to shrink into the darkness, but her heart pounded so loudly she was sure everyone could hear it.</p><p>Her father caught her eye, his gaze steady. Something unspoken passed between them—a plea, a farewell, she couldn’t tell.</p><hr><p>That night, Xiao Lan lay awake, the forbidden book pressed to her chest. Outside, the square was restless—hushed voices, boots on cobbles, distant sobbing. She could see the bonfires from her window, books and paintings and family heirlooms set aflame. The city choked on the smell of burning paper and broken memory.</p><p>She remembered her father’s stories, told in the gold dust hour between dinner and dusk, about his childhood in the south, the bitter war, the years at university before the world was remade. He had taught her to recite poems, to puzzle out English words, to imagine beyond what was permitted. Now each lesson seemed like a luxury turned curse.</p><p>When dawn broke, the shouting returned. Another meeting, another denunciation. Xiao Lan’s mother, eyes hollow, pressed a steamed bun into her hand for the day—meager comfort, but love all the same.</p><p>At school, things had changed. The lines between student and Red Guard blurred. Teachers vanished for “re-education.” Students watched each other, notebooks filling with observations—so-and-so had laughed during the anthem, this one whispered too long by the river, that one’s family received letters from overseas.</p><p>Xiao Lan kept to herself, moving like a ghost. She noticed the empty chairs growing in number. Girls who’d once plaited her hair disappeared, their families loaded onto trucks at dawn.</p><p>She learned to speak less, to ask no questions, to mimic the slogans with just enough conviction. At home, her mother wept over a photograph hidden in a flour jar, rice weevils crawling between the family portraits.</p><hr><p>One day near the river, Xiao Lan stumbled upon Mrs. Weng sitting on the steps, clutching a tattered copy of <em>Dream of the Red Chamber</em>. The librarian looked up, her cheeks streaked with tears.</p><p>“Do you ever wonder,” Mrs. Weng whispered, “what this country would be if we cared more for words than for slogans?”</p><p>Xiao Lan didn’t answer, but she stayed, hunched beside her in silence, tucking her knees to her chest. They watched the river slide by, slow and indifferent.</p><hr><p>Months passed. The city grew smaller, quieter. The Red Guards faded away, replaced by military cadres in pressed uniforms. Hunger set in—a gnawing ache that hollowed cheeks and thinned tempers. The old, once-gleaming proud faces of the revolution, looked tired now, their banners limp in the winter wind.</p><p>One morning, Xiao Lan’s mother, thin and stooped, handed her a note—a message from an old neighbor, someone she barely remembered. It was a single line: “Your father is being sent away. Tomorrow. Three o’clock.”</p><p>She ran, breath ragged, to the edge of the city where the trains left. Along the tracks, men and women gathered, clutching bundles—woolen clothes, broken radios, pilfered rice. Soldiers herded them along, rifles slung careless over shoulders.</p><p>Xiao Lan spotted her father, gaunt but upright, a red cloth armband tied around his wrist. He looked smaller, older.</p><p>She pressed through the throng. When he saw her, something bright flickered in his eyes. “Lan, don’t cry. I will write when I can. You must look after your mother. Be strong. Be wise.”</p><p>She wanted to say a thousand things, to promise worlds, but words withered under the ache in her chest. Instead, she handed him the battered volume she’d hidden for months—<em>The Family.</em> He gripped it, eyes shining.</p><p>“I will treasure this,” he whispered.</p><p>Then the whistle blew, and the soldiers moved them along, the living river of lost fathers ebbing away into the barren steppe beyond memory.</p><hr><p>Years later, Xiao Lan would recall that day—the cold crunch of gravel under soldiers’ boots, her father’s last smile, serener than she’d ever seen it. She would remember growing up in the second shadow of loss, reading forbidden books by lantern-light, finding comfort in Mrs. Weng’s furtive gatherings of old souls and broken dreamers.</p><p>As the city rebuilt, as the posters faded and a different silence settled, Xiao Lan became a teacher—like her father, but different. She taught with a quiet fierceness, slipping poems between approved lessons, encouraging questions instead of fear. Her students carried stories in their hearts, unafraid to remember what had been lost.</p><p>Some nights, watching the river shimmer under the city lights, Xiao Lan thought of all the things hidden and buried, of stories smoldering beneath the ashes. She thought of the price of remembrance, and the peculiar, indomitable hope that survived even beneath the gaze of those who would silence it.</p><p>For even in the hardest times, she had learned, words—carefully tended, secretly cherished—could outlast even the darkest night.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/cultural-revolutions/>Cultural Revolutions</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/beneath-the-red-banner-stories-of-survival-in-the-cultural-revolution/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Beneath the Red Banner: Stories of Survival in the Cultural Revolution</span>
