In a region torn apart by ethnic violence, his clinic became a sanctuary for victims—regardless of their affiliations.</p><p>Coming from a minority community himself, Amir’s commitment went beyond medical care. He meticulously documented war crimes, providing evidence that human rights organizations used to advocate for justice and accountability.</p><p>One night, militants raided his clinic, warning him to stop his work.
