The city had always been a place where different cultures collided, creating a vibrant yet fractured community. In the past, there had been whispers of unity, but now, those voices were drowned out by the growing walls between neighborhoods. The lines were clear: the rich lived in the upper districts, while the poor, the marginalized, and those deemed &ldquo;other&rdquo; were pushed into the heart of the city&rsquo;s decay.</p><p>Jasmine watched the setting sun from her small apartment window. The faint orange glow barely filtered through the grime on the glass, but she knew this was the time. The time when the world outside seemed to hold its breath—before the night would swallow it all.</p><p>It had been months since she had moved to Hollis Ridge from a quieter town, seeking new opportunities and a fresh start. But every day in this city felt like a battle. The world outside was divided into two kinds of people: those who fit, and those who didn’t. Jasmine didn’t fit.</p><p>Her skin, darker than most in the city, made her an outsider. It wasn’t just her appearance, but her way of thinking, her ideals, her belief that people could change—that they could grow past their fears. But in Hollis Ridge, fear was not just a feeling; it was a currency. People were afraid of each other, afraid of the unknown, and especially afraid of those who looked or acted different.</p><p>She pulled her coat tighter around her shoulders, feeling the weight of history pressing down on her. This city had built its walls not just out of stone and steel, but out of fear. Fear of difference. Fear of change. Fear of what might happen if they let someone in.</p><hr><p>The subway ride to her evening shift at the local diner was always the same. Crowded. Stifling. Cold. Her stop was near the edge of the city, in a district where people like her didn’t always feel safe. As the train lurched forward, she caught the eyes of a man standing near the door. He wore a weathered coat, his hands shoved deep into his pockets, eyes darting around as if looking for an escape. She had seen him before. His name was Victor, and while he wasn’t a frequent visitor to her part of town, he was a familiar face—a reminder of the world beyond the walls.</p><p>The train screeched to a halt, and Victor stepped off. Jasmine’s stomach twisted as she watched him disappear into the evening crowd. It wasn’t that she was afraid of him, but of what he represented. He was a symbol of the divide that defined this place—a reminder that the city had been cleaved into two halves, with no middle ground. There were no spaces for people like her, and those like Victor could only exist in the margins.</p><hr><p>The diner was quieter than usual when Jasmine arrived, the fluorescent lights buzzing overhead. Her coworkers moved with mechanical precision, a silent choreography of survival. There was Tommy, the grumpy cook, who had a permanent frown etched into his face; Clara, the waitress who had been here for years and knew just how to smile to get by; and, of course, Rose, the manager, who barely spoke but had a way of making you feel as though you were always on the edge of being reprimanded.</p><p>&ldquo;Evening, Jasmine,&rdquo; Clara greeted her, her eyes barely lifting from the counter as she wiped it down.</p><p>&ldquo;Evening, Clara,&rdquo; Jasmine replied, trying to sound cheerful. She quickly tied her apron around her waist and began organizing her station.</p><p>&ldquo;Big night tonight,&rdquo; Tommy muttered from the kitchen. &ldquo;It’s always busy on Sundays, you know. People trying to make up for a week of bad decisions with food.”</p><p>Jasmine didn’t respond. She had learned not to engage with Tommy’s negativity. Instead, she focused on the task at hand, setting up her station with efficiency. She couldn’t let herself be distracted. Not tonight.</p><p>She caught sight of Rose standing near the back door, her arms crossed. Rose never seemed to show emotion—her face always cold, her gaze sharp. Jasmine had tried to understand Rose’s guarded nature but had long since given up. Everyone had their reasons for hiding behind walls.</p><p>&ldquo;Jasmine,&rdquo; Rose called out, her voice firm. &ldquo;I need you to serve Table Five. The regulars.&rdquo;</p><p>Jasmine nodded and grabbed a tray of water before walking toward the table in the corner. She had seen them before—the couple that always came in on Sundays, their faces an odd mixture of friendliness and caution. They didn’t talk much, only ordering their food and sipping their drinks in silence. They didn’t say anything to her when she brought them their orders, and they certainly didn’t look at her with kindness.</p><p>She set down the water on their table and turned to leave. But as she walked away, she overheard a whispered conversation that made her stop in her tracks.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you think they really belong here?&rdquo; The man’s voice was low, filled with uncertainty.</p><p>His companion’s voice was sharp, but it held a touch of fear. &ldquo;Of course not. People like her—&rdquo; There was a pause before the sentence continued. &ldquo;They don’t belong in places like this. It’s dangerous, you know. What if they try to change everything?&rdquo;</p><p>Jasmine’s heart pounded in her chest, and she quickly walked away, her mind swirling with the weight of the conversation. She wasn’t blind to the prejudices that existed in Hollis Ridge, but hearing it spoken so plainly was something else entirely. It wasn’t just fear of what she looked like—it was fear of her existence in a place that wasn’t supposed to have space for people like her. People who dared to hope for change.</p><hr><p>That night, as Jasmine walked home, the streets felt colder than usual. The city&rsquo;s oppressive atmosphere seemed heavier, thicker, like it was closing in on her. She could feel the gaze of every passerby, each one carrying their own silent judgment. It was as though the world was watching her, waiting for her to fail.</p><p>As she turned a corner, she saw Victor again. This time, he was standing outside a small convenience store, his back against the wall, his eyes scanning the street. He didn’t seem to notice her, but Jasmine couldn’t help herself. She walked closer, the weight of the moment pressing down on her.</p><p>&ldquo;Victor,&rdquo; she said softly, not quite sure why she was speaking to him. &ldquo;Are you alright?&rdquo;</p><p>He turned to her, startled, as though he had forgotten there were still people in this city who cared enough to speak to him. His eyes softened for a moment, and he gave a brief nod.</p><p>&ldquo;I’m fine,&rdquo; he replied, his voice rough. &ldquo;Just trying to make it through the day.&rdquo;</p><p>Jasmine nodded, unsure of what else to say. The silence between them was heavy, filled with the unspoken truths that neither of them was willing to voice. But in that moment, something shifted. She wasn’t just the outsider anymore. For a brief second, they were two people, sharing the same space in a city that had long since forgotten what it meant to belong.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you ever think things could change?&rdquo; she asked, the question slipping out before she could stop it.</p><p>Victor’s gaze hardened. &ldquo;I don’t know,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;I used to. But now, I just keep my head down and stay out of trouble. This place&mldr; it’s not meant for people like us.&rdquo;</p><p>Jasmine felt the sting of his words. It was the same thing she had been told for months. People like them didn’t belong. People like her were a threat to the established order.</p><p>But she couldn’t accept that. Not anymore.</p><hr><p>Over the next few weeks, Jasmine began to notice something strange. The walls around her—those invisible barriers built from fear and prejudice—seemed to be crumbling, just a little. She had started talking to people who lived on the other side of the divide, in neighborhoods she had been told were off-limits. And to her surprise, some of them welcomed her.</p><p>One afternoon, she ran into Clara again at the corner market, and for the first time, Clara didn’t avoid her gaze. She smiled and asked if Jasmine wanted to grab a cup of coffee after her shift. They sat together, talking about everything and nothing, and as they did, the world around them seemed a little less divided.</p><p>Jasmine had learned something crucial: fear wasn’t just a feeling. It was a weapon. But it could also be dismantled, piece by piece, through small, quiet acts of connection. One conversation at a time.</p><p>And though she had a long way to go, she was ready to keep fighting. For herself. For Victor. For everyone in this city who felt like they didn’t belong.</p><p>Because in a divided world, the color of fear could be changed. It just took the courage to look past it and see the possibility of something better.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/racism-and-prejudice/>Racism and Prejudice</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-color-of-courage-short-stories-fighting-prejudice/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Color of Courage: Short Stories Fighting Prejudice</span>
