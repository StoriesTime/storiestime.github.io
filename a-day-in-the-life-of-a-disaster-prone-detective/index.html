The scent of fresh coffee wafted through the cracked windows of the detective agency, mingling with the sharp, stale odor of unidentifiable paperwork that had accumulated over the years. A single fluorescent bulb flickered above the desk of Simon Reid, a detective with a reputation not for solving crimes, but for attracting chaos.</p><p>Simon leaned back in his creaky chair, stretching his tired limbs. His morning had begun like any other, with an unspectacular cup of coffee and the hope that today might be the day he got through without catastrophe. But knowing Simon, it was only a matter of time before disaster struck.</p><p>As he sipped his coffee, the phone on his cluttered desk rang. He stared at it, the noise slicing through the otherwise calm atmosphere. His heart sank. The number on the caller ID wasn’t familiar, but that never stopped the cases from pouring in. He picked up the receiver, bracing himself for whatever calamity was about to unfold.</p><p>&ldquo;Reid Investigations,&rdquo; he said, trying to sound more competent than he felt.</p><p>&ldquo;Detective Reid, this is Inspector Harris. I need you to meet me at the old warehouse on 5th Street. We’ve got a situation.&rdquo;</p><p>Simon sighed. This wasn’t good. He didn’t need to ask what kind of situation it was. It was always the same: a case that would somehow spiral out of control, pushing him deeper into the abyss of disaster.</p><p>&ldquo;Got it. I’ll be there in twenty,&rdquo; Simon muttered, hanging up before Harris could add more details. He grabbed his jacket off the back of his chair and hurried out of the office, making sure to avoid knocking over the stack of files precariously balanced on his desk.</p><p>As he stepped into the crisp morning air, Simon could already feel the weight of impending misfortune. He had a knack for attracting trouble. Whether it was getting locked in the wrong building or tripping over his own shoelaces while chasing a suspect, disaster followed Simon like a shadow. Today, it seemed, would be no different.</p><hr><p>The old warehouse on 5th Street was exactly as Simon had expected—decrepit, abandoned, and filled with the faint smell of mildew and rust. He parked his beat-up sedan across the street and walked over to the entrance, where Inspector Harris stood with her arms crossed, clearly exasperated.</p><p>&ldquo;About time you showed up,&rdquo; Harris said, not bothering with pleasantries. &ldquo;Inside. We’ve got a serious problem.&rdquo;</p><p>Simon followed her inside, squinting as his eyes adjusted to the dim lighting. The warehouse was large, its high ceilings echoing with the sound of footsteps. Boxes were stacked haphazardly around the space, and the faint sound of dripping water came from somewhere deeper inside. Harris led him toward a group of officers gathered around a tarp, their faces grim.</p><p>&ldquo;Is this the victim?&rdquo; Simon asked, pointing to the shape under the tarp.</p><p>Harris nodded. &ldquo;Yeah. But here’s the catch: it’s not a simple murder. The body’s been completely drained of blood.&rdquo;</p><p>Simon blinked, his mind already racing through possible scenarios. &ldquo;What do you mean ‘drained’?&rdquo;</p><p>Harris gestured to the body. &ldquo;No blood. None at all. It’s like someone sucked it right out of them.&rdquo;</p><p>Simon crouched down, examining the body more closely. The person was dressed in dark clothing, their face obscured by the angle of their head. But what struck Simon immediately was the unnatural pallor of the skin. It looked almost… drained.</p><p>&ldquo;Any signs of struggle?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;None,&rdquo; Harris replied. &ldquo;No wounds, no defensive marks. Just… nothing.&rdquo;</p><p>Simon rubbed his chin thoughtfully. &ldquo;Who was the victim?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We’re still working on ID,&rdquo; Harris said. &ldquo;But we found a wallet nearby. It belonged to a man named Gary Roberts, a local mechanic. No known ties to anything shady, though.&rdquo;</p><p>A local mechanic. Simon’s mind clicked into gear. The case was bizarre, but it wasn’t entirely out of the ordinary. Strange things had happened before—people had disappeared, bodies had shown up in odd places. But the blood-draining? That was new.</p><p>He stood up and dusted off his knees. &ldquo;Let’s get this over with. I need to take a look around.&rdquo;</p><p>As Simon began to walk deeper into the warehouse, his foot caught on a loose floorboard. He stumbled forward, barely managing to catch himself on a nearby stack of crates. The disaster-prone detective had made his entrance.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, that was graceful,&rdquo; Harris muttered from behind him.</p><p>Simon shot her a sheepish grin. &ldquo;You know me, Harris. If something’s going to go wrong, I’m your guy.&rdquo;</p><hr><p>The next few hours were a blur of interviews, investigations, and deductions. Simon had visited the local mechanic’s shop, questioning Gary Roberts’ colleagues, but they didn’t know much. Gary had been an ordinary guy, with no signs of a double life or criminal involvement. Simon had also spoken with a few of Gary’s neighbors, but no one had heard anything strange in the days leading up to his death.</p><p>The detective’s next step was to track down Gary’s family. That was where things started to get even stranger.</p><hr><p>When Simon arrived at Gary’s home, he was greeted by the sight of a young woman sitting on the porch, staring at the ground. Her eyes were red, as though she had been crying for hours.</p><p>&ldquo;Miss Roberts?&rdquo; Simon asked gently.</p><p>She looked up, startled. &ldquo;Who are you? What do you want?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I’m Detective Simon Reid. I’m investigating the death of your brother, Gary.&rdquo;</p><p>The woman’s face darkened. &ldquo;You don’t know anything, do you? About what he was mixed up in…&rdquo;</p><p>Simon stepped closer, lowering his voice. &ldquo;What do you mean? What was he involved in?&rdquo;</p><p>Her eyes flickered nervously. &ldquo;He was… into something strange. He kept talking about these people he was meeting, these… groups. I didn’t understand, but it was like he was being drawn into something dark. Something dangerous.&rdquo;</p><p>Simon’s gut twisted. &ldquo;Do you know who they were?&rdquo;</p><p>She shook her head. &ldquo;No. He wouldn’t tell me. But after a while, he started acting… different. Like he wasn’t himself anymore.&rdquo;</p><p>Simon paused, the pieces beginning to form in his mind. A mechanic who had suddenly started acting strangely, talking about mysterious groups—this was starting to sound like something much bigger than a simple murder. It wasn’t just about Gary’s death anymore. Something much darker was at play.</p><p>As Simon stood up, his phone rang again. He glanced at the screen and saw the familiar number of his office. It was his assistant, Janet.</p><p>&ldquo;Detective, you might want to come back to the office,&rdquo; Janet said, her voice tight with urgency. &ldquo;There’s a man here asking about you. He says he knows something about Gary Roberts, but… he’s not exactly in the best condition.&rdquo;</p><p>Simon’s heart rate spiked. &ldquo;What do you mean ‘not in the best condition’?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He’s covered in blood, Detective. And he looks like he’s been through hell.&rdquo;</p><hr><p>By the time Simon arrived back at his office, the man was already seated in his chair, his hands trembling as he clutched a coffee cup. His face was gaunt, eyes wide with fear, and blood stained his clothes.</p><p>&ldquo;I need to talk to you about Gary,&rdquo; the man rasped, his voice hoarse.</p><p>Simon narrowed his eyes. &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I’m… I’m Danny,&rdquo; the man stammered. &ldquo;I used to work with him. I was with him the night he… the night he disappeared.&rdquo;</p><p>Simon sat down across from him, trying to remain composed. &ldquo;What happened that night?&rdquo;</p><p>Danny’s eyes flickered nervously, and he glanced around the office, as though making sure no one else was listening. &ldquo;I don’t know. I don’t know, but whatever it was—it wasn’t human. It was something else. And Gary… he didn’t just die. He became part of it.&rdquo;</p><p>The words hung in the air, heavy and impossible to believe.</p><p>Simon leaned forward, heart pounding. &ldquo;What do you mean, ‘became part of it’?&rdquo;</p><p>Danny’s eyes locked onto Simon’s, filled with terror. &ldquo;The blood, Detective. They—whatever they are—they take it. They drain it. And they leave you like him. Dead. Empty.&rdquo;</p><p>Before Simon could ask more questions, Danny bolted up from the chair, his eyes wide with terror. &ldquo;They’re coming for me. They know I’m here.&rdquo;</p><p>Simon barely had time to react before the man dashed out of the office, slamming the door behind him. He rushed to the window, his pulse racing. Outside, a group of shadowy figures stood across the street, watching him with unsettling precision.</p><p>Simon took a deep breath. This wasn’t just another case. This was something much bigger, something that could change everything. And he, Simon Reid, was right in the middle of it all.</p><hr><p>As Simon stood there, his heart pounding in his chest, he couldn’t help but feel the weight of his reputation bearing down on him. Disaster had found him once again, and this time, it wasn’t just about falling into traps or stumbling over his own feet.</p><p>It was about survival.</p><p>And in his line of work, survival wasn’t guaranteed.</p><p>But one thing was certain: Simon Reid wasn’t backing down. Not this time.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/comedy-and-humor/>Comedy and Humor</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/a-day-in-the-life-of-a-comically-over-prepared-parent/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>A Day in the Life of a Comically Over-Prepared Parent</span>
