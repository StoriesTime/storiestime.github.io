Not just in the usual way, but in a new, unsettling kind of silence that had settled over everything. It was the kind of stillness that made the air feel thick, like it was waiting for something. Or perhaps, like it was trying to forget.</p><p>Claire had always loved the sound of her footsteps echoing on a quiet street, but now it made her feel smaller, more isolated. As she stepped out of her apartment, the familiar world outside seemed to have transformed. The city, once teeming with life, was now a shell of its former self, a silent witness to the chaos that had unfolded.</p><p>It had been months since the world had changed—since the pandemic swept across the globe, leaving people behind, locked away in their homes, each struggling to adapt. At first, it had felt like a temporary blip, a brief interruption. But as the weeks turned into months, the realization hit: this was going to be the new normal. Social distance had become a phrase on everyone&rsquo;s lips, a concept that had to be embraced, no matter how unnatural it felt.</p><p>Claire had taken to walking alone in the mornings. The streets were emptier, but somehow, that made the distance between her and the rest of the world feel even greater. She had heard the phrase &ldquo;Six Feet Apart&rdquo; so many times that it had started to lose its meaning, becoming just another rule to follow. But each time she saw a person walking in the opposite direction, the instinct to step away, to keep that precious six feet between them, felt like a reflex.</p><p>She turned a corner and saw a familiar face—Hannah, an old friend from her university days. They had always joked about their awkward social encounters, about how they never seemed to quite fit into the same social circles. Now, the awkwardness was palpable, magnified by the invisible barrier that divided them.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Claire!&rdquo; Hannah called out, her voice tinged with a mixture of surprise and hesitation. She took a step forward but stopped herself, glancing at the ground as if unsure of the proper etiquette in this new world.</p><p>Claire smiled, a little too brightly. &ldquo;Hey, Hannah! It&rsquo;s&mldr; good to see you.&rdquo;</p><p>They stood there, two people who had once shared countless conversations and laughter, now separated by an invisible line, both unsure of how to bridge the gap. They both looked at the ground, avoiding each other’s gaze for a moment.</p><p>&ldquo;How have you been?&rdquo; Hannah asked, finally breaking the silence.</p><p>Claire shrugged. &ldquo;You know&mldr; adjusting. It&rsquo;s strange, isn&rsquo;t it? All of this.&rdquo;</p><p>Hannah nodded. &ldquo;Yeah, everything feels so&mldr; distant now. Like we&rsquo;re all living in different worlds, but we&rsquo;re still stuck together somehow.&rdquo;</p><p>They both laughed, but the sound was hollow. They knew the truth behind the words—they weren&rsquo;t just physically apart, they were emotionally distant too. The pandemic had done more than just separate people with physical space; it had distanced them in ways they hadn&rsquo;t anticipated. It had forced people to face their own isolation, their own fears, their own vulnerabilities.</p><p>&ldquo;I miss the old days,&rdquo; Claire said softly. &ldquo;Before all of this. Before everything changed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Me too,&rdquo; Hannah agreed. &ldquo;It feels like we&rsquo;re waiting for something to happen, but we&rsquo;re not sure what. Like time is standing still.&rdquo;</p><p>They exchanged a look, both understanding the weight of the words. Time had become a strange concept during the pandemic. It was no longer marked by events or plans, but by the passing of days in solitude. Every day felt the same, a blur of hours that stretched out, never quite reaching the future they had once expected.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you think it will ever go back to normal?&rdquo; Claire asked, her voice barely above a whisper.</p><p>Hannah shook her head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. Not the same way. I think we&rsquo;ll find a new normal, but it&rsquo;ll be different. It&rsquo;ll take time.&rdquo;</p><p>Claire looked down the street, where a group of people were gathered at a distance, talking and laughing, but still careful to keep their space. She wondered what it would be like to be part of that group, to be close to people again, to share the same air, the same space, without fear.</p><p>But that was the thing about fear—it had a way of changing everything. It made even the most ordinary things feel dangerous. It made people second-guess their every move, their every interaction. It was exhausting, and yet, it was something they had to live with. The world had become a place where six feet apart was the safest distance, the only distance that could offer any kind of protection.</p><p>Hannah broke the silence again. &ldquo;Have you been keeping in touch with anyone? I mean, outside of all this?&rdquo;</p><p>Claire thought for a moment. &ldquo;Not really. I talk to my family sometimes, but it&rsquo;s&mldr; not the same. I feel like everything has become so&mldr; virtual. It&rsquo;s hard to connect the same way.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Hannah agreed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like we&rsquo;re all just living in different time zones now. Everything feels disconnected. Like we&rsquo;re watching each other&rsquo;s lives from the outside.&rdquo;</p><p>Claire nodded, feeling the weight of those words. It was true. No matter how many virtual meetings or video calls they had, it was never quite the same. It was like watching a movie where the characters were always just a little out of reach, always just a little too far to touch.</p><p>They both fell into silence again, each lost in their own thoughts, both trying to navigate this strange new world.</p><p>&ldquo;I guess we just have to keep going,&rdquo; Claire said finally, breaking the silence. &ldquo;One step at a time. Six feet apart, one day at a time.&rdquo;</p><p>Hannah smiled, a small, wistful smile. &ldquo;Yeah. One day at a time.&rdquo;</p><p>They stood there for a moment, each trying to find some semblance of normality in the strange, new world they found themselves in. The world had changed, but they were still here, still walking forward, even if it was at a distance.</p><p>As Claire turned to leave, she glanced over her shoulder at Hannah, who was still standing in the same spot, looking as lost in thought as Claire had felt just moments before. And for a brief moment, despite the distance, it felt like maybe things weren&rsquo;t as distant as they seemed. Maybe, just maybe, there was still a chance for connection, even in a world that had been forced to separate.</p><hr><p>The days stretched on, each one feeling like it was both a lifetime and a moment in time. Claire had learned to adjust, to find new ways of connecting with the world around her. She had become used to the rhythm of life in social distance, where each interaction was measured and carefully calculated, where the space between people was not just a physical barrier but a reminder of the fragility of everything.</p><p>She had started volunteering at a local food bank, a place where she could help, even if from a distance. It was strange at first, working in a place where so many people were in need but where the rules of social distancing still applied. She had to keep her distance from the people she was helping, to wear gloves and masks, to sanitize every surface after touching it.</p><p>But there was something comforting about it too. Helping others, even in small ways, gave her a sense of purpose, a feeling that, despite the isolation, she was still part of something larger. It was a small act of rebellion against the distance, a refusal to let the world completely unravel.</p><p>One day, while volunteering, Claire met a woman named Maria. She was older, in her late sixties, and she had been coming to the food bank for weeks. She always came alone, a small, fragile figure carrying a bag that was a little too big for her. The first time Claire saw her, she had a strange sense of recognition. Maria reminded her of her grandmother, who had passed away years ago.</p><p>Maria was quiet, her eyes filled with the kind of sadness that comes from a life lived with both hope and loss. But there was also something resilient in her. She didn&rsquo;t complain, didn&rsquo;t ask for more than what was offered. She simply took what she needed and left, always with a polite smile.</p><p>One day, after a long shift, Claire found herself standing outside the food bank, the setting sun casting long shadows across the empty street. Maria was sitting on a bench, her bag beside her, staring at the ground.</p><p>Without thinking, Claire walked over and sat next to her. They didn&rsquo;t speak at first, just shared the quiet of the evening. It felt strange, sitting so close to someone but still separated by the invisible line of social distance.</p><p>Finally, Maria looked up, meeting Claire&rsquo;s gaze. &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said softly. &ldquo;For helping. For being here.&rdquo;</p><p>Claire smiled, a little embarrassed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing. I just&mldr; I wanted to help. I think we all need to help each other, more than ever now.&rdquo;</p><p>Maria nodded. &ldquo;Yes. We do. Even if we can&rsquo;t be close&mldr; we still need each other.&rdquo;</p><p>For a moment, they sat there in silence, the world around them still and quiet. The space between them was still there, the six feet of distance that had come to define their interactions. But in that moment, Claire realized that the distance wasn&rsquo;t the thing that mattered. It was the connection, however small, however fragile, that made all the difference.</p><p>As the sun dipped below the horizon, Claire stood up, offering Maria a hand. &ldquo;Take care,&rdquo; she said, her voice gentle but firm.</p><p>Maria smiled, taking the hand with a warmth that transcended distance. &ldquo;You too. Stay safe.&rdquo;</p><p>And as Claire walked away, she felt a little lighter, a little less alone. In a world where everything seemed to be divided, where six feet apart had become the rule, she had found something that no distance could take away: a reminder that even in the darkest of times, connection was still possible. It just had to be found in new ways, at new distances.</p><p>And maybe, just maybe, that was enough.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/pandemic-stories/>Pandemic Stories</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/six-feet-apart-a-collection-of-distant-lives/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Six Feet Apart: A Collection of Distant Lives</span>
