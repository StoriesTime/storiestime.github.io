His love for cooking far surpassed that of any villager. Within his railway-hearted kitchen, Gustave was always breathing in the scent of sizzling pans and stirring the pot of countless culinary concoctions. His existence radiated in the flavors he concocted, the tempest of tastes which he siphoned, imported, and showcased in the most beguiling of dishes, enchanting even the most discerning of palates.</p><p>In the market square, while his competitors were hawking their fish and fowl, Gustave was seducing with his stories of culinary triumphs. Talking with eyes ablaze and fingers twitching, he immersed everyone in his experiences. Accounts of thumps of airborne spice, tales of pastries so tenderly pillowing their sweet treats, some stories even waltzed the waltzing somber pallet of blackened crackling doorway fare.</p><p>One fateful market day, a strange and deliciously curious woman sidled beside him, murmuring SECRET SYSTEMS in his ear before disappearing as suddenly as she came, leaving a faint and teasing aroma of distinctly exotic spices. Gustave, conscious of his erstwhile wares, began searching for these secret systems, journeying far beyond the village&rsquo;s fustian selvedge. He aimed to obtain the prowess she reflected, dreams ensnared in the lops and bunny hops of the culinary world.</p><p>His first voyages took him into lands steeped in silken spices. There, he filtered and combed the shard-strewn moonscape of spice-rich landscapes. Gustave kvetch no more! Onward! Across the emerald seas he sailed, dodging windswept spume as he edged northwards. As the years at sea flapped by in the fluttering laps of barnacled jibs, so too did Gustave&rsquo;s vast reports of nautical yarns grow. Then, one day at the hillock of dusk, a strange man clad in rags coasted onto the clay-mud shore.</p><p>Radiating ennui like a sun-baked road, the vagabond knew of Gustave&rsquo;s long blades of stretching sail and his requisite Gaelic wavelength. Knowing of his fondness for secret systems, the stranger broke an almost inescapable bond of secrecy, telling Gustave quite matter-of-factly of a magical cookbook hidden within the spice-infested fortress of a desert. The knowledge bound in its pages promised answers to all known culinary riddles - as well as a few still unborn.</p><p>In a flash, Gustave fashioned charts and maps, carving his own blood into their fibers to ensure a rigidity of steadfast purpose. No word or promise of propriety could hold him back in this chase. Gustave, willingly walking off the edge of his village, made a discreet wink at the azure space where his sails once floated. With his parting words, he divulged a drop of intruding moonlight to the somber seascapes beneath him.</p><p>Aboard his first steed, a rickety sled guided by a forlorn howitzer, Gustave rushed until his droming extinguished, aiming straight for his heart&rsquo;s desires. Stealthily he inserted himself into the belly of the stony dunes, avoiding guardsmen and censors as the sun dipped below the horizon each parched and precipitous eve. Stretching lunar beams cast jigsaw puzzles on the fortress walls, Gustave sneaked into the culinary catacombs.</p><p>In the deepest, dust-drenched recesses of the fortress, Gustave found the mysterious cookbook: black as ink and fluttering with the faintest ember of mystical dust. His fingers shook with stolen desire, usurped only by the heaving palpitations of his cakewalked heart. Thumbed open, the historic volume shivered before him, its cursus alive like static shivering as Gustave breathed upon the brittle, overworn pages. His breath wrapped the air around the book&rsquo;s contents, causing the pages to reveal a surreal swirl of balsamic syrup.</p><p>Reading the golden letters aloud, Gustave whispered prayers to the culinary gods as information and knowledge melted onto his tongue. Cultivating a new understanding of his ancient craft, he pilfered not only techniques, but wisdom beyond his wildest dreams. Gustave bathed in the cascade of his newest fortune, waltzing with the unending ebb and flow of his latest journey; it had all marshaled into a tempest of unshackled flavor that threatened to deluge the caverns&rsquo; musty air.</p><p>He hummed upon leaving the fortress, clutching the grimoire as if purging his insides and retroactively feeding all his culinary pride into the gust-parched earth. But in his very wake, shadows rippling and shimmering, the original cookbook&rsquo;s demented maxim whispered everlastingly through the mosaic of spices that only solitary gusts of wind could unlace. By daybreak, he vanished behind dunes as molten and impassable as ever, leaving no imprint of his valiant pilgrimage.</p><p>As Gustave returned to his village devoid of vision, he found that everything looked and tasted the same.</p><p>But in the twilight of the kitchen - once his only friend, now his tyrannical master - he could feel new vigor beginning to burgeon. The symphony of secret systems plucked when he laid his hands upon the pulsing tome as the sun dipped below the horizon. Suspended in a silent bubble of possibility, Gustave no longer yearned for the whispering winds of flavors and essences gone awry. In his garret, like a sewing machine tirelessly stitching culinary triumphs, he found a new xenophobe of knowledge waiting to be sashed onto the parchment of time.</p><p>Gustave&rsquo;s heart echoed with the gigantic, fallow-dry whispers of style unbroken. Invisible gowns of spices merged at the station of incredible culinary dexterity, where Gustave&rsquo;s all-encompassing markers smudged into enigmatic forgeries and dreamt of the mysterious woman&rsquo;s viscera.</p><p>Her love was birthed anew, and the reason for Gustave&rsquo;s disappearance; now everlasting, the world opened up to accept his secret systems.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/culinary-adventures/>Culinary Adventures</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-food-explorer-short-stories-of-culinary-adventures-and-culture/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Food Explorer: Short Stories of Culinary Adventures and Culture</span>
