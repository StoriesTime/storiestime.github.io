The discovery of a stable wormhole, allowing for faster-than-light travel, had made it possible to explore and settle other planets. However, as Earth's resources began to dwindle, the United Earth Government made the difficult decision to abandon the home planet and establish a new home on a remote floating colony in the depths of space.
Orbit Colonization
Located in the heart of the Milky Way galaxy, the floating colony of Aurora was designed to be a self-sustaining community, capable of harnessing its own energy and resources. This orbiting city boasted a unique ecosystem, complete with artificial rivers, forests, and even a circular steel mountain range that pierced the sky like a jagged crown.
The colony was home to over 100,000 humans, each living in harmony with the colony's intricate systems. Artificial gravity, created by the colony's rotating sections, ensured that residents lived normal lives, free from the debilitating effects of prolonged weightlessness. Climate control maintained an ideal atmosphere, and the colony's vast agricultural sectors provided a voracious diet of fruits, vegetables, and grains.
The Federation of Worlds
The colony's social structure was governed by the interplanetary Federation of Worlds, a coalition of nations that had banded together to share knowledge, resources, and diplomatic expertise. Aurora was a thriving regional hub, hosting diplomats, ambassadors, and high-ranking officials from all corners of the cosmos.
This turn of events did not occur without its controversies. Tensions simmered among different factions, accused of opportunism and willing corruption. With so many competing voices vying for power, Aurora's free press struggled to ensure a level of media accuracy in the face of unfading speculation.
Vossil, The Initiator
Our protagonist, Erebus "Vossil" Ogden, was a humble mechanic and machinist living in Aurora's lower section, aptly nicknamed the Canaille. The vocational city, upholding integrity and trade, led Vossil's journey with dilettante naval routes.
Little was known of his affluent upbringing. Surviving on welfare for many impoverished months, the cohorts only became orphaned toddlers when compelled to string savored old passion into hopeful guesses.
