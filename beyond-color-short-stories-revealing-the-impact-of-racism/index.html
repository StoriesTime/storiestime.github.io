It was late, too late for someone who had long abandoned the idea of being just another cog in the corporate machine. But tonight, the usual hum of the office had been replaced by something more unsettling. The chatter of coworkers, once background noise to his routine, had begun to carry an edge—an undercurrent that felt foreign and uncomfortable.</p><p>He had been at this firm for five years. Five years of feeling like he was walking on a tightrope, balancing between his desire to succeed and the unspoken truth that his presence here was never fully accepted. Tariq, an African American man in a predominantly white office, had long learned to wear his mask. The mask that hid the frustration, the fatigue, and the quiet indignities of being the &ldquo;only one.&rdquo;</p><p>But tonight, things felt different. The conversation at the coffee machine had shifted, and now, as he sipped his own mug in the corner, he listened closely.</p><p>&ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t understand how they can get away with it,&rdquo; Jessica, one of his colleagues, was saying. &ldquo;I mean, the violence in those neighborhoods&mldr; it&rsquo;s like they don&rsquo;t even care about their own lives.&rdquo;</p><p>Tariq’s hand froze mid-air as he reached for his coffee. It wasn’t the first time he&rsquo;d overheard such a remark, but tonight it hit differently. The words felt sharper, more venomous. His mind raced—he had heard it all before. The whispers about &ldquo;those people,&rdquo; the implications that their struggles were self-inflicted, and worse, that somehow, they deserved it.</p><p>He could feel his pulse quicken, the familiar weight of the microaggressions that had been building inside him for years pressing down harder. In that moment, the mask he had so carefully crafted began to crack.</p><p>&ldquo;How can you say that?&rdquo; Tariq’s voice was more forceful than he intended, his grip on his coffee mug tightening as he stood up.</p><p>Jessica looked startled, but not ashamed. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; she asked innocently, though Tariq knew better. There was always an underlying defensiveness when these conversations arose.</p><p>Tariq took a deep breath, gathering his thoughts before responding. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like. You don&rsquo;t know the history. It&rsquo;s not just a matter of &rsquo;those people&rsquo; making bad choices. It&rsquo;s centuries of oppression, of a system that’s built to keep people like me down.&rdquo;</p><p>Jessica blinked, clearly caught off guard by the intensity of his response. A few other coworkers turned to listen, but no one said anything. The silence that followed was suffocating.</p><p>&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; Tariq continued, his voice softer now, &ldquo;I’m not asking you to understand it all in one conversation, but I want you to stop pretending that we all start on the same playing field. It’s not that simple.&rdquo;</p><p>Jessica opened her mouth to reply, but then hesitated. The moment stretched on, and for a brief instant, Tariq wondered if this would be the time—finally—the moment where his words would sink in, where the veil of ignorance would lift. But the moment passed, and Jessica simply muttered something about needing to get back to her work, walking away without looking back.</p><p>Tariq sat back down at his desk, the noise of the office now a dull hum. He didn’t expect things to change overnight. It never worked like that. He had spent his whole life trying to make sense of the way the world treated him. It wasn’t just the occasional comment or glance; it was the cumulative weight of thousands of small things that built up over time, eroding his sense of self.</p><p>He had been raised to believe that hard work would be the answer, that if he just excelled enough, if he just pushed himself harder than everyone else, the world would eventually see him for who he was—a talented, driven individual, not defined by the color of his skin. But the reality had been far different.</p><h3 id=chapter-2-the-burden-of-representation>Chapter 2: The Burden of Representation</h3><p>Tariq was the only Black member of the executive team. He often wondered how it felt for the others. How could they sit in meetings, offering their opinions on topics like diversity and inclusion, when none of them truly understood what it meant to live in a world that judged you solely based on how you looked?</p><p>It wasn’t just the comments about &ldquo;those neighborhoods&rdquo; or the casual assumptions about people of color. It was the weight of always having to represent an entire group, as if his success or failure was a reflection of every Black person in the world. He couldn’t simply be Tariq, a man who had worked his way up the corporate ladder; he had to be the representative of an entire race, the &ldquo;good Black man&rdquo; who could prove that all the stereotypes were wrong.</p><p>The pressure was suffocating. At the last board meeting, when he spoke about a new initiative to address hiring disparities, he had been met with polite smiles and nods, but the skeptical glances that followed had not escaped his notice. He had spent years advocating for diversity, for the inclusion of voices that had been historically silenced, but even his best efforts had been met with resistance and tokenism.</p><p>&ldquo;Why should I have to constantly explain myself?&rdquo; he thought, standing before the window in his office later that evening, staring out at the city below. The world outside was alive with motion, but in here, in his quiet corner of the building, it was a place of stillness. A place where his thoughts ran wild, and the frustration swelled in his chest like a tidal wave.</p><p>He thought of his younger brother, Malik, and how different his experiences would be. Malik was still in college, still full of hope and idealism. Tariq had tried to shield him from the harsh realities of the world, tried to convince him that with enough perseverance, success was inevitable. But the truth was becoming harder to deny: the world didn’t play fair. No matter how hard you worked, no matter how good you were, there would always be those who saw you as less than.</p><p>Tariq’s phone buzzed, and he snapped out of his reverie. It was a message from Malik.</p><p><em>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s work? Still killing it?&rdquo;</em></p><p>Tariq smiled a little. Malik’s optimism was both a balm and a reminder of how far he had come. He typed a quick reply.</p><p><em>&ldquo;Trying to. It&rsquo;s complicated, though. Things aren&rsquo;t always as simple as they seem.&rdquo;</em></p><p>He hesitated before hitting send, unsure how much of the truth he should share. He didn’t want to burden Malik with his battles, especially when he still had so much to fight for. Instead, he followed with another message.</p><p><em>&ldquo;But I’m good. Don’t worry about me.&rdquo;</em></p><p>He set his phone down, staring at it for a moment before turning back to the window. The city was quiet now, the lights twinkling like stars in the distance. For a brief moment, he allowed himself to imagine a different life—one where his success wasn’t measured by the color of his skin, where he didn’t have to be the &ldquo;exception&rdquo; to prove that Black people were capable of greatness.</p><p>But that was a dream, and dreams, Tariq knew, were often just that—fantasies. The real world was far messier, far more complicated.</p><h3 id=chapter-3-the-weight-of-silence>Chapter 3: The Weight of Silence</h3><p>It was a week later when the incident occurred. Tariq was in a meeting with the CEO and the senior leadership team, discussing the company’s latest diversity and inclusion efforts. As usual, he was the only person of color in the room, a fact that he had long ago grown used to.</p><p>But today, something felt different. There was a tension in the air, a subtle unease that none of them seemed willing to acknowledge. The conversation had veered into uncomfortable territory when John, the CFO, mentioned a recent news story about a police shooting in another city.</p><p>&ldquo;I just don’t get it,&rdquo; John said, shaking his head. &ldquo;Why do they resist so much? It’s like they don’t want help, you know?&rdquo;</p><p>Tariq felt the color drain from his face. The words hung in the air, thick with prejudice. He had heard this before, of course. The assumption that people who protested or spoke out against injustice were somehow the problem, not the systems that had caused the injustice in the first place.</p><p>Tariq opened his mouth, but the words wouldn’t come. The weight of the silence that followed the comment was suffocating. He could feel the eyes of the room on him, waiting for him to say something. To speak up. To represent.</p><p>But in that moment, he didn’t have the strength to. Instead, he forced a smile and nodded, pretending as if nothing had happened. The conversation moved on, but the damage had already been done. The resentment, the frustration, the anger—it all built up inside him like a pressure cooker, waiting to explode.</p><p>Later that day, as he sat in his office alone, Tariq let out a long, shaky breath. He had been quiet too many times. He had allowed others to speak over him, to dismiss his experiences, to reduce his existence to a set of assumptions based on the color of his skin.</p><p>But no more. He would no longer remain silent.</p><h3 id=chapter-4-the-breaking-point>Chapter 4: The Breaking Point</h3><p>Tariq’s resolve grew stronger as the days passed. He started speaking up in meetings, challenging the prejudices and assumptions that had been allowed to flourish unchecked. He began to push for real change—change that would address the systemic issues within the company, rather than just paying lip service to diversity.</p><p>And, slowly, things started to shift. Some of his colleagues resisted, but many others began to listen. They started to understand the weight of his words, the years of frustration and pain that had been buried beneath his calm exterior.</p><p>But it wasn’t easy. The road ahead was long, and the battle for true equality was far from over. Tariq knew that. But for the first time in his career, he felt a flicker of hope.</p><p>Perhaps, he thought, change was possible—one conversation at a time.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/racism-and-prejudice/>Racism and Prejudice</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/beyond-color-short-stories-fighting-racism/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Beyond Color: Short Stories Fighting Racism</span>
