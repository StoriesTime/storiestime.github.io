With an effort, however, I succeeded in deciphering the characters and found that they told of a treasure which had long disappeared.</p><p>In shivering the wind through the ivy that clung about the deserted ruins, there came a sound distinct and awful. The desolate chamber kept up its dismal secrets; but a voice from within the walls, a rustling of hereditary tapestry, a shifting of the picture, as it were, upon the canvas, the deepest midnight hours, as the church clock struck twelve.</p><p>The auditors sat with their eyes fixed upon the floor, which seemed to have a glow like that of the embers about which the Christmas fire has been burned low. However, it was only the embers of my pipe, which for the twentieth time that evening I had, by a sudden thought, stuffed into the bracket of my old grand piano. In the forgotten squares of an evening paper had come a tiny slip of paper, folded as if for a secret purpose. It bore a message in minute characters, a message read once and fluttered onto my knee, then slipped away beyond recall.</p><p>&ldquo;Travelers passing by this old mansion should take heed the musings of the minds within — beware the ghosts of yesteryear.&rdquo; Thus spoke the weathered brass plaque set beneath the mansion&rsquo;s porch. I knew that the hour had come to honor the final bequest of the late, once much-scrutinized butler. I had come to a decisive crossroads in the pursuit of unraveling the inscrutable. Next to &ldquo;Das Rheingold,&rdquo; set apart on the top floor and accessible by a single door, would remain the Gallery&rsquo;s Guardian. Beside the dim glow of the sigil — a symbol of protection — the waiting began.</p><p>During the first several hours, I knew I&rsquo;d have time to think. As the Gallery&rsquo;s Guardian, I&rsquo;d taken every precaution, every conceivable measure to ensure my own safety. Given that I had escaped the scrutinizing eyes of the police, my next challenge would be to confront the inexplicable methods my predecessor, Damien Roth, had used. But, what befell him at the end? I recalled the whispered conversations of our small circle: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone mad!&rdquo; They exclaimed. Such anarchy! Such political upheavals! This Europe was but the shadow of the latter-day tyrant. Our children would remember but that which we had indited them.</p><p>From there, knowledge is ambition&rsquo;s stepchild. To progress faster, I considered that my journey up the staircase involved more than just ancient, forgotten lore, the Gallery&rsquo;s guarding of secrets, and Damien&rsquo;s actions. I realized that it was a dance I had begun. To unveil what they had concealed, I needed to understand the gravity and repercussions of the art crimes. And it was at this stage that the grand mystery unraveled.</p><p>A chill wind whipped around the corners of the mansion&rsquo;s uppermost floor. Shadows danced alongside the dim candlelight, a bizarre ballet of darkness and illumination. The secrets held within must be unveiled — unless interred forever by a lower nature still unwitting. We, therefore, have undertaken a process of these venerated Gallery&rsquo;s guardians, knowing that key to the fabled treasure unbeheld profound mysteries would thereafter arise.</p><p>Obituaries appeared, Damien&rsquo;s dissolution reported in veiled language by those still in the knowledge trade. From coalition insiders, I heard tell of art works bartered in covert operations. Still, Damien had lost his marbles or, sort of, been spurned or put out to pasture prior to the notorious heist in the shadows.</p><p>&ldquo;What is to be done then?&rdquo; cried one, as this clandestine chamber of iniquity unfolded. As the Gallery&rsquo;s Guardian, I was seized with a passion such as only this distraught family and the men who had defrauded Damien of his taken tapestries could feel. Dead or alive? into the shadowed realm, the incorrigible artist had passed, leaving no wake, no trace, and no tidings of himself to the curiosity of the faithful.</p><p>&ldquo;Those which seem the most helpless and forsaken are imbued with all the powers of the angels and giants to perform the difficult tasks which have been denied to men.&rdquo; Just so it was with me. In the heart of the night, with the renovation near its end, my plans unfolded.</p><p>&ldquo;The torchlight dims with each turn and trembles in my hand; these walls are mine, my fortress of solitude. Face to face confronting my colleagues, I shifted beneath the epitaph only a scholar of however little power of criticism would call original. The breadth and versatility of these antediluvian manuscripts released the passages closed off by cobwebs and dust clods and, deep within the shadows, confronted the story&rsquo;s beginning to unfold.&rdquo;</p><p>Dim awareness crept into the recesses of my being like the incremental lighting of a hearth; my task began. Trained in ancient languages, my mastery of hidden demarcations, cryptographies, and hieroglyphics whispered in my ear the tale that the walls attempted to squeeze from my soul. Feverishly my hands rummaged through inconceivable artifacts bequeathed to me, deciphering the secrets concealed within that ancient record. Time and again, that voice from beyond the veil would guide me to the wished solution.</p><p>Within the sanctuary of my heart, calm as in the cold sleep of the grave, I discovered the treasure hidden for centuries, heralded by the late, much-scrutinized butler from chapter to my chapter. From the terrestrial walls to the celestial vault, hallowed be the secrets I penetrated, let the errant soul of art and life once more begin.</p><p>The testimony before the spiritual guardians of hidden art echo with the voices of the damned and forsaken. Damien, once seeking redemptive justice for a manhood defiled, had to claim mastery over the shrouded arts or face eternal damnation.</p><p>&ldquo;We must cling more desperately to that which we create and possess,&rdquo; I mused, &ldquo;that art be not forgotten, and the memories of days long past unstained.&rdquo;</p><p>But this phrase, drawn with uncanny skill, renders it too deeply for my translation from the andante to the allegretto.</p><p>As minutes waned and midnight approached, my dance paused, and I tread lightly upon the hallowed ground. Labor and learning, thought and power, and many-sided wisdom — these were for me on this memorable night.</p><p>And that which was to be found after the chase of ensuing hours would be reserved for another in a story.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/robbery-and-heists/>Robbery and Heists</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/art-gallery-robbery-stolen-masterpieces-and-a-web-of-lies/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Art Gallery Robbery: Stolen Masterpieces and a Web of Lies</span>
