It had been two years since he left to work on the northern wall, and each spring, when the river thawed and the wind carried a salt-sweet promise, her memory of him sharpened like a flute note after silence.</p><p>She awoke before the sun, lacing her shoes with trembling hands, determination burning beneath her steely calm. There was no more waiting. Not after the stranger had brought news from the frontier—rumors that men fell ill, that food was scarce, and that names were read at dawn for those who would return south: so few.</p><p>Huixin’s mother watched her daughter pack. She fussed with the water flask, the wrapped buns, the red thread tied around Huixin’s wrist for luck. They did not speak of sorrow or fear; instead, her mother pressed their hands together once, gaze fierce as a mountain bolt. The silence a blessing, or a shield.</p><p>The world beyond the southern rice paddies bloomed as something wondrous and risky. At first, fields bent softly to the horizon and time passed in gentle days. Villagers offered her boiled eggs and hot tea, some marveling at the audacity of a girl setting out alone. She listened to stories, drawing mute courage from their voices. It seemed that each traveler was marked by longing: a brother conscripted, a son vanished in dust, a husband sending only bones home.</p><p>Still, there was kindness—a fisherman who rowed her across a swollen stream, a cart driver who let her doze among the cabbages as he trundled northward. In exchange, she mended torn clothes and told them of her village’s endless green. At night she gazed at the stars and traced the constellation her father once named: the Dragon’s Gate, where legends said the brave became heroes.</p><p>As hillocks hardened into rocky spines and the air thinned, the road turned harsher. Soldiers on patrol eyed travelers with suspicion; each checkpoint exacted a cost. Huixin learned to wrap her face, hold her tongue, and carry herself with neither pride nor alarm. She gathered gossip—whispers of the endless construction, the laborers’ songs by lantern light, the stone sentries standing against some unseen foe.</p><p>On the fourteenth night, stumbling into a market town, she met Li An. Tall, rawboned, his hands black with ink from copying ledgers, he recognized something desperate in her questions. Over broth heavy with ginger, he spoke quietly: he once had a sister who went missing on these same roads.</p><p>“You seek the builders, not the soldiers,” Li An said, tracing a jagged line in spilled rice. “That is harder now. The authorities avoid villages for fear of sickness. But there’s a back path, if you trust me.”</p><p>So over dew-silvered ridges they trekked, moving by moonlight, sometimes only sleeping when exhausted, sometimes not at all. Li An shared dried persimmons and slow, wry stories that eased the worst of Huixin’s loneliness. She learned of his family’s farm, lost to river floods, and felt something like kinship swell in the pause between their words.</p><p>On the sixteenth day, the scent of pine thickened—the sign they were close.</p><p>The Wall soared before her at dawn, a jagged backbone across the land’s shoulder. The stones glistened with frost, an unbroken gray ribbon that rippled east and west past the edge of sight. Bell towers and watchhouses punctuated its length, and, above all, a thrumming sense of power and grief: so many hands had shaped this winding behemoth.</p><p>They slipped into a camp at the base, weaving through canvas tents splayed like petals. Smoke coiled from makeshift hearths, the sharp tang of millet porridge and boiled cabbage mingling with the bracing wind. Men shuffled, gaunt and gray, patched uniforms hanging off lean shoulders. A few women toiled too, hauling bricks or boiling linens, eyes either hardened or hollow.</p><p>Huixin’s voice faltered as she asked about her father. There were so many faces, so many who looked like him in the dim morning gloom. She recited his name to a cook, to laundrywomen, to the medic who bound bleeding hands.</p><p>Hours blurred. Snow flurried along the ramparts. Someone wrapped a woolen blanket around her; another pressed a warm gourd to her palm. Hope ebbed and swelled with every answer and denial.</p><p>Near dusk, Li An found her seated on a rock, a silent sentinel gazing at the endless Wall. He sat beside her, and for a while, only the wind spoke.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” he said. “Some leave, some fall ill. The records…not always kept well.”</p><p>Huixin clenched the red thread at her wrist. She would not return empty-handed. She would climb the Wall itself if she must.</p><p>She rose, resolve kindled.</p><p>They negotiated passage with a captain—a thin man, fierce-eyed, who at first wanted to send her away. But when Huixin explained—halting, trembling, but unyielding—why she had come, something shifted in his face. He waved them through an archway yawning with shadow.</p><p>Night shrouded the great stones; frost crackled beneath their feet as they climbed. For the first time, Huixin scaled the monstrous steps she had imagined for countless nights—a vertigo of awe, of bone-deep history, of sorrow but also hope.</p><p>On the parapet, the world reeled wide. Mountains tumbled in blue waves, villages smoked in far-away hollows, the wind snapped like dragon’s breath. Watchmen huddled in battered cloaks; a few sang softly, lullabies carried from provinces so distant their names blurred in the mind.</p><p>And finally, so quietly it seemed almost a trick, her father stood before her. Paler, thinner, but his eyes still bright with mischief and warmth.</p><p>He saw her, and his breath caught.</p><p><em>Huixin?</em></p><p>They embraced. There was disbelief, then laughter, then tears. The Wall faded—no longer a monument to war or suffering, but a bridge forged by love and boneheaded courage.</p><p>Stories flowed, swift as spring thaw. Huixin recounted each risk, each nameless friendship, each small mercy. Her father spoke of burdens and camaraderie, the nights spent laying stone on stone, singing through hunger, finding solace in stars.</p><p>Li An smiled from the shadows, his face lit by the lamps guttering against the wind—a silent benediction.</p><p>Huixin stayed three days at the camp, weaving through alleys of canvas and fire. She aided the cooks, bandaged blisters, and sat by the sick, telling tales until dawn bled into the clouds. They listened—a flicker of relief, the sound of home in her words.</p><p>On the fourth morning, father and daughter began the long walk south. The Wall’s silhouette receded, growing softer as fields and mountains resumed their patient shapes.</p><p>But Huixin kept a fragment of that cold gray stone in her pocket—a talisman, a reminder. She bore stories now, stories etched deeper than scars: of a world grueling but kind, of strangers risking all for a scrap of hope, of a journey’s end that was truly a beginning.</p><p>Even after long years, through change and loss, the tale was retold—by the birth fires of children, at the edge of old age, whenever someone asked about courage. The Great Wall, she would say, is not just a wall. It is each step, each choice, each leap of faith.</p><p>And she would smile, winding the red thread still bright at her wrist, knowing that every journey matters—especially the ones that carry us home.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/iconic-landmarks/>Iconic Landmarks</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/journey-through-time-stories-behind-the-colosseum/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Journey Through Time: Stories Behind the Colosseum</span>
