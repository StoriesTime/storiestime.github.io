Below, the valley stretched in every direction, suffused in the dusky glow of the fading day and spotted with purple grasses that whispered in the wind. Among the alien vegetation stood the settlement—a cluster of dome-shaped habitats, solar arrays, and silos—humanity’s final foothold in the cosmos. They called it Elysium, though some joked it was more semblance of irony than hope.</p><p>It had been 87 Earth years since the expedition ship <em>Ardent Horizon</em> had touched down on Pyxis-3. Back then, no one had referred to it as &ldquo;the last colony.&rdquo; It was marketed as a new beginning, a bold step into humanity’s future beyond the crumbling Earth. Yet as the years went by, the radio signals stopped coming. Earth, whether by environmental collapse, geopolitical catastrophe, or cosmic misfortune, had gone silent. By now, most of the colonists born after the first generation believed their planet of origin to be little more than a myth—a story told by aging pioneers clinging to the memory of blue skies and oceans vast enough to swallow the horizon.</p><p>Avola Kess, one of those storytellers, squinted as the suns began their final descent. She leaned heavily on her staff—carved from the carbonwood of native trees—and adjusted the rebreather mask over her face. Her dark gray hair haloed wildly in the wind, streaked with silver strands like veins of metal embedded in rock. She gazed out at the far edges of the settlement, where walls of reinforced bio-concrete now stood, a necessary barrier against the roving swarms of needlebeasts that prowled the planet’s wastelands.</p><p>“Every day it shifts,” she muttered aloud, the dry rasp of her voice carried away by the breeze. “Every day, Pyxis changes, and we change with it.”</p><p>“Talking to yourself again?” came a younger voice behind her.</p><p>Avola turned to see Lin Rellen, a mechanic and part-time forager, ascending the crest, her boots kicking up fine red dust. Lin’s jumpsuit was patched in so many places it seemed a miracle it held together. In her hands, she held a scavenged analysis drone—one that looked long past functional.</p><p>“Old habit,” Avola replied, her lips twitching into a faint smile. “How was the outpost run?”</p><p>“Not great,” Lin sighed, plopping herself down on a nearby rock. “Third drone this week. The bio-currents out there are frying the electronics faster than we can shield them. Also found another patch of metallic moss creeping toward the desalination lines. If it breaches, we’re looking at water contamination. Remind me again why we thought this planet was habitable?”</p><p>Avola chuckled mirthlessly, the sound dry and brittle like the wind. “Because the surveyors didn’t stay long enough to see how it bites back.”</p><p>Lin frowned, tossing a pebble across the uneven ground. It tumbled down the ridge, disappearing into the tall grasses below. “Do you ever wonder if we should have moved to Sector Eight instead of fortifying this place? They say the climate’s more stable down there.”</p><p>“They say a lot of things,” Avola replied. “Have you seen Sector Eight with your own eyes?”</p><p>Lin’s silence was telling.</p><p>“It’s better here,” Avola continued after a pause. “We’re higher up, less open to flood zones or magnetic anomalies. Besides, here we have history. The graves of the first settlers. Our roots in this alien soil.”</p><p>“Roots,” Lin repeated, shaking her head. “Funny. The way things are going, roots might be all that’s left.”</p><hr><p>Night fell swiftly on Pyxis-3, and with it came the frost. Despite the relative warmth of the day, temperatures plunged the moment the suns vanished beyond the jagged mountains. Inside her quarters, Avola stirred a pot of cax root broth, breathing in its nutty aroma as condensation formed along the reinforced glass windows. The lights flickered once before stabilizing—a reminder of how precariously balanced their entire existence was.</p><p>She sat in a low chair, staring at the holographic map projected onto the wall. It showed the known territories surrounding Elysium, though much of the planet remained unexplored. The great salt plains to the west were marked with caution symbols, as were the acid rain zones of the southern basin and the dense fungal forests to the east. Avola’s finger traced the northern boundary, where jagged lines indicated the mountainous regions.</p><p>Her thoughts wandered to rumors. Whispered stories passed between foragers and scavengers—of things moving in the mountains. Of lights brighter than any colonist-made flare. Some dismissed them as atmospheric phenomena or the hallucinations of dehydrated travelers. But Avola had seen enough of Pyxis’ unpredictability not to discount the possibility of threats yet unknown.</p><p>The door chimed once, breaking her reverie.</p><p>“Come in,” she called.</p><p>The door slid open with a faint hiss, and Matreus Dal, one of the colony&rsquo;s lead scientists, entered. His lanky frame looked even more awkward in the heavy jacket he wore over his standard-issue garb. He carried a data slate, its screen flickering with charts and readings.</p><p>“Avola,” he began without preamble. “We need to talk about the harvest schedules.”</p><p>She sighed, gesturing for him to sit. “What’s wrong now?”</p><p>“It’s the xi’la vines,” Matreus explained, dropping into the chair across from her. “Their growth cycles are skewing faster than anticipated. We’re already seeing nutrient leeching in the soil where they’ve been cultivated too long. If we don’t rotate soon, we could lose half the southern fields.”</p><p>“Again?” Avola frowned. “That’s the third time this year. Is it the solar irregularities?”</p><p>“Could be,” Matreus said, sounding unconvinced. “We don’t even know what ‘normal’ growth patterns on this planet look like. Every time we think we have a foothold, something throws us off balance.”</p><p>Avola drummed her fingers on the table. The xi’la vines were one of the colony’s most important resources, not just for sustenance but for weaving durable fibers and synthesizing basic medicines. Losing even part of the fields would be catastrophic.</p><p>“What do you need?” she asked finally.</p><p>“Authority to expand cultivation zones,” Matreus said quickly. “If we can clear a patch near Ironwood Lake and start fresh, we might—”</p><p>“No,” she interrupted. “We don’t have the manpower or the resources to be clearing new territory right now. It’s too dangerous.”</p><p>“But—”</p><p>“We adapt,” Avola said firmly. “We always adapt. That’s the way it’s been since day one.”</p><p>Matreus exhaled sharply, clearly dissatisfied, but he nodded. No one argued much after Avola had the final word. Not because she held any official position of leadership—those days of clear governance had ended decades ago. Rather, it was because she had survived longer than most, her judgment tempered by years of hardship on this hostile world.</p><hr><p>By morning, the frost had already melted under the heat of the rising suns. Lin was back at work repairing one of the colony’s wind turbines while Matreus coordinated with the greenhouse crews. Avola kept to herself, preparing her gear for a scouting expedition along the northern ridge. Though few ventured that way, she felt a pull—a nagging sense of unfinished business.</p><p>As the hours stretched on and the twin suns climbed higher, she reached the edge of the familiar. Beyond lay uncharted terrain, a land both beautiful and treacherous. The air smelled sharper here, tinged with hints of metal and ozone. Avola paused, her eyes scanning the horizon.</p><p>Movement.</p><p>She froze, heart pounding. Not a needlebeast. Not a scavenger bird. It was… different. The air shimmered faintly, like the heat distortions over sand dunes back on Earth. And in that shimmer, shapes began to emerge—tall, spindly, their forms flickering like static.</p><p>For the first time in years, Avola felt a deep pang of fear. Life on Pyxis-3 had conditioned her to face hardship and danger with calm resolve. But this? This was something wholly unfamiliar.</p><p>Her instincts screamed to turn back, to warn the settlement. But she couldn’t. Not yet.</p><p>Slowly, she tightened her grip on her staff and stepped forward into the unknown.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/space-exploration/>Space Exploration</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-last-colony-life-beyond-earth/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Last Colony: Life Beyond Earth</span>
