She slid onto the creaky stool beside her best friend Sam, who tweaked the end of her scrunched-up nose affectionately and shoved a foam-tipped dart at her.</p><p>&ldquo;Try to beat my high score this time, Ems,&rdquo; Sam demanded, half-teasing, half-serious. Emily rolled her eyes and aimed, inhaling sharply and exhaling purposely in an attempt to steady her hand. She enjoyed playing darts, but tonight found it hard to concentrate as her mind kept wandering, which was unusual.</p><p>Suddenly, a rugged-looking man with piercing, knowing eyes half-obscured by his messy beard swigged a pint of foamy-dark liquid, chuckling with his boys. Emily couldn&rsquo;t help but stare. It seemed as if he could see deep into her soul, and the unnerving sensation made goosebumps prick her skin. Then, inexplicably, the man&rsquo;s eyes met hers, and an electrifying jolt coursed through her veins, instilling a sense of recognition and familiarity that she couldn&rsquo;t explain.</p><p>&ldquo;Sam, did you feel that?&rdquo; she hissed, voice barely above a whisper, her dart left discarded on the board. Sam&rsquo;s alert blue eyes glanced at her then back to the dartboard, puzzled by her odd demeanor. But now Emily couldn&rsquo;t shake this peculiar sensation – it was almost as if she&rsquo;d known this man before.</p><p>Sam finished his round of darts and patted Emily&rsquo;s shaky hand reassuringly. &ldquo;Em, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Her breathing quickened as she attempted to articulate her feelings. Her lips for once struggled to form words. Her thoughts were muddled – she could barely piece together a coherent thought.</p><p>The man finished his drink, stood up with surprising speed and agility for a man of his size, and approached Emily. His husky voice drowning out the cacophony of bar noises, &lsquo;Perhaps it is destin&mldr;,&rsquo; he began, before a gust of wind slammed the tavern door with such force that half-empty bottles behind the bar trembled. Everyone fell silent.</p><p>In the ensuing moment of hushed anticipation, the mysterious man placed a sizable, calloused hand on Emily&rsquo;s shoulder and whispered in her ear, &ldquo;Forget not who you are.&rdquo;</p><p>Then, with a popping sound and a burst of light, Emily found herself lying on the cobblestone street outside Ye Olde Rusty Jug, her elbow scraped and throbbing, her best-forgotten fairy tale reports from her high school years in mind.</p><p>She rolled over, mascara smudging into her cheeks, to find that the world had become an almost comical combination of Luc Besson&rsquo;s Fifth Element and the Legend of Zelda, complete with glowing, ethereal creatures soaring in the night sky!</p><p>&ldquo;I suppose you need a crash course,&rdquo; the rugged man said, extending a strong hand to help her up. The same hand which just a moment ago seemed to penetrate and understand her soul, or so it felt, flashed a knowing smile that held her captive, illustrated with pointed canines and charismatic charm. His eyes softened with the age-old wisdom common among scholars, and insisted on guiding her through this fantastical world she never knew existed.</p><p>&ldquo;I am Adal,&rdquo; he began, his composure belied his excitement, &ldquo;and you, my dear, are not just an ordinary woman. You have always been needed for a task, held in secret waiting, to be awakened when the great balance was threatened – an ancient prophecy and safeguard of the universe.&rdquo;</p><p>Unbeknownst to Emily, she&rsquo;d always possessed extraordinary powers such as boosting morale, diminishing others&rsquo; stress, telepathic abilities, and a well of untapped energy that unveiled itself at crucial moments. She resisted the urge to touch her head gently, looking back at Adal incredulously.</p><p>&ldquo;Why me?&rdquo; she asked quietly, nervously.</p><p>&ldquo;Because no one had the stubborn will and the strength you carry within,&rdquo; he whispered. From that moment, Emily&rsquo;s life forever altered its course. She&rsquo;d become the accidental sidekick, embarking on uncharted realms and unexpected alliances, where all previous preconceived notions and constraints melted away like ice in the sun.</p><p>And while laughter remained chief amongst her arsenal, her powers and path were finally clear.</p><p>The gravitational pull of her newfound role attracted tumultuous challenges, charming anecdotes, and bewildering encounters that this former English major, avid world builder, and high school musical extra was never anticipated to face.</p><p>Embarking on epic quests, Emily found her bonds with others transformed, forged in the fire of common struggle and dreams she&rsquo;d never imagined. She fought alongside beings with unimaginable wisdom and strength, triumphing over fears and uncertainties that once served as the boulders in her path.</p><p>Never again would Emily sip lukewarm lager while watching her friends gossip and jabber over trivial matters, or stand folly-brained among poster-covered walls at closed-door conventions, pining for triumphant worlds she could only dream of existing. As she steeled an unwavering resolve in the company of her companions, her accidental sidekick status now a glowing badge of honor, Emily Chronic leaped fearlessly into the great unknown.</p><p><strong>Emily&rsquo;s journey was far from ordinary, and with each new step, her resolve and power magnified, proving the extraordinary potential ever hidden within. And in her corn-cob pipe, sage or toadstool iPhone case spirit, she discovered the magic and courage she never knew she had. Adal&rsquo;s words echoed through the ages: &lsquo;You were never ordinary, and now you have both the truth and a purpose.&rsquo;</strong></p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/comedy-and-humor/>Comedy and Humor</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-accidental-hero-a-comedy-of-errors/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Accidental Hero: A Comedy of Errors</span>
