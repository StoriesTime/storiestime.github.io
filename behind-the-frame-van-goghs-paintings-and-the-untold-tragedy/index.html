With his daring use of vivid colors swirling into deliberate and calculated chaos, Van Gogh managed to give a voice to the otherwise silent voices of the countryside and working-class people, immortalizing their struggles and joys on canvas. However, his personal life unfolded like a profound tragedy, most of which remained untold. Here is a glimpse into the life behind the frame.</p><p>In the beginning, there was Vincent, an aloof boy relating more with nature than with his fellow beings. Often misunderstood, Vincent found solace in the color-wheel and brush. It all started with humble beginnings. His father gave him his first formal training, the guidance and understanding fostering an aura of inspiration around the budding young artist. However, Vincent&rsquo;s life took a sudden turn when he was 29. Plagued by intense bouts of anxiety and depression, Vincent was gripped by the darkness that would define the rest of his life.</p><p>The tragedy began with the loss of his mother when he was 12. Succumbing to their financial predicament, his father attempted the treacherous journey to South America, leaving Vincent and his brother behind. This distance plunged Vincent into a loneliness that intensified his emotional problems. His first brushes with mental instability commenced during his time at the institution for the insane.</p><p>The asylum stay was complete with bizarre episodes of trance-like states, hunger for solitude, solitude of hunger, fits of anxiety, and deep-seated dependency. However, it was his serious attack of mental illness that eventually took him to the St. Paul-Remember DeGieter ad, near Paris.</p><p>Still, the tragedy replicated itself. Van Gogh&rsquo;s dedication to art was unparalleled, yet his social and financial ineptitude was no less significant. He was often misunderstood, insulted, and even derided for his work. His financial difficulties forced him to sell paintings to fund his basic living expenses. It was a heart-rending manifestation of an artist&rsquo;s struggle.</p><p>After three years of selling most of his paintings, Van Gogh decided to auction off his very personal and precious collection of Japanese prints to a ­– Japanese art dealer, Theo&rsquo;s old friend, Ta"He" VI ie Vincent S. Richter. The prints would bring him enough funds for him to commute to the ad, where he hoped to work and get better.</p><p>But further tragedy struck. A misunderstanding led to a violent altercation causing a gunshot wound in his right arm. Being &ldquo;unclean&rdquo; was an offense, so, he was ostracized from the ad community and was compelled to live by his art again, even more desperately this time. His friend&rsquo;s offer to move closer to Theo in Arles fell flat.</p><p>Nevertheless, it was not just Vincent&rsquo;s personal tragedy that unfolds behind these masterpieces. It was also the tragedy of an artist whose work was misunderstood or even dismissed when first exhibited, or overlooked. But, a powerful message of hope and resilience emerged, which turned Vincent Van Gogh into one of the most renowned painters of his time.</p><p>Vincent&rsquo;s art was and continues to be dismantled as an interpretation of his emotional state – the colors, the stokes, they tell a tale. But despite the tragic circumstances of his personal life, the 10 years of Van Gogh&rsquo;s work managed to deal unforeseen pain with a solitary, almost surreal beauty. His art enhances our human understanding of Vincent&rsquo;s pain, a unique glimpse into an enigmatic life, and an unnerving journey through tragic stories behind some of the most iconic art pieces in the world.</p><p>For anyone profoundly moved by the complexity and distinctive beauty of Van Gogh&rsquo;s last artworks, there&rsquo;s a story beyond the evocative swirls of color. And this story, my friends, is a tragic tale of Vincent Van Gogh, a tale of darkness so profound that it helped create some of the most exquisite paintings humanity has ever seen.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/historical-figures/>Historical Figures</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/behind-the-crown-intriguing-tales-of-royal-historical-figures/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Behind the Crown: Intriguing Tales of Royal Historical Figures</span>
