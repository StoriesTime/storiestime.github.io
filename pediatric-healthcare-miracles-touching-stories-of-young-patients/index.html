Each operation was a step toward a stronger heart, but it was the multidisciplinary care—nutritionists, physiotherapists, psychologists—helping Sophia regain her strength that made the difference.</p><p>Her story highlights not only surgical success but the holistic approach that pediatric cardiac care now embraces. This comprehensive support network ensures that children recover fully and thrive beyond the hospital walls.</p><h2 id=miguels-triumph-over-type-1-diabetes>Miguel’s Triumph Over Type 1 Diabetes</h2><p>Miguel was only five when diagnosed with type 1 diabetes.
