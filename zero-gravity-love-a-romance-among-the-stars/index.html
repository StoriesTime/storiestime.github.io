Tamyra Chase floated just above her workstation, twisting her body gently as she checked the readings on the hydroponic systems. Rows of tomatoes hovered in neatly arranged magnetic fields, their vines curling ever so slightly as if reaching for an invisible sun. The generated light panels above them pulsed a soft, golden hue. It should have been comforting, but Tamyra couldn&rsquo;t shake the weight in her chest.</p><p>It was ironic, really, how the vast emptiness of space could make you feel so heavy.</p><p>She focused on the task at hand, logging the data with the touchpad strapped to her forearm. Her crewmates, an eclectic medley of engineers, scientists, and navigators, each had their own routines, their own solace in the tedious patterns of star-jumping. For Tamyra, it was the greenhouse — her personal haven on this ship of steel and programmed order.</p><p>Her hand was steady as she reached for a tendril of vine, yet her thoughts wandered. It had been six months since the <em>Eos Voyager</em> had left Helios Station. Six months of floating through the cosmos in pursuit of habitable worlds. Six months of calm professionalism, interrupted only by occasional bouts of laughter or the brief flicker of personal stories shared over reconstituted meals. And six months of avoiding him.</p><p>Tamyra flinched at the sharp sound of the hydroponic door&rsquo;s pressure seal disengaging. She didn&rsquo;t need to turn around to know who it was. She could already sense his presence, the way the space around him always seemed warmer, more vibrant.</p><p>&ldquo;Your sanctuary again?&rdquo; Nathan Wilde’s voice carried that familiar teasing lilt, but there was an undercurrent of softness — a question he didn’t dare speak aloud.</p><p>&ldquo;Nate,&rdquo; she replied, trying to keep her tone neutral. &ldquo;What brings you to my patch of green?&rdquo;</p><p>He let out a low chuckle, the kind that sent something unnameable fluttering in her stomach. &ldquo;Wanted to check on the only spot on this ship that doesn’t feel like an engineering deck broke loose. Got room for one more gardener?&rdquo;</p><p>Tamyra turned, floating backward to give him space as the automatic door sealed itself behind him. Nathan, with his perpetually tousled dark hair and the subtle shadow of stubble, grinned in that boyish way of his. But it wasn’t just his charm that unnerved her. It was his eyes—eyes that seemed to see past her layers of logic and protocol to something vulnerable, something raw.</p><p>&ldquo;It’s not gardening you’re after,&rdquo; she said, narrowing her gaze in mock suspicion. &ldquo;You just want to steal a tomato again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A guy’s gotta eat real food every once in a while,&rdquo; he quipped. &ldquo;Those nutrient bars are proof space travel hates us.&rdquo;</p><p>She shook her head, bemused. Against her better judgment, she tossed a cherry tomato his way. In the zero-gravity environment, it drifted lazily across the space between them. Nathan snatched it mid-air with a grin.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, survival rations,&rdquo; he said before popping it into his mouth. He closed his eyes dramatically as he chewed. &ldquo;Perfect. You’ve outdone yourself, Tamyra.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Now get out of my greenhouse,&rdquo; she replied, but there was no venom in her voice.</p><p>Nathan didn’t leave.</p><p>Instead, he drifted closer, his movements slow and deliberate. In zero-gravity, every slight gesture carried meaning, from the bend of an elbow to the flex of a foot. It felt like a dance, this microcosmic choreography they’d fallen into without discussion or acknowledgment.</p><p>&ldquo;Tamyra,&rdquo; he said, her name lingering in the air like an unspoken promise. &ldquo;Why are you always running away from me?&rdquo;</p><p>The question hit her harder than she expected, even though she’d asked herself the same thing countless times. She turned her back to him, focusing on the curling tomato vines that couldn’t offer any answers.</p><p>Nathan continued, his voice softer now. &ldquo;I’ve seen you in the observation deck. You stay longer than anyone else, staring out at the stars, like you&rsquo;re looking for something, or someone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And what are you doing in the observation deck, Nate?&rdquo; she retorted, not unkindly. &ldquo;Watching me watch the stars? Sounds creepy.&rdquo;</p><p>He laughed softly. &ldquo;Touché.&rdquo; Then, after a beat, he added, &ldquo;Maybe I just hoped you’d say something.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And what would I say? That I miss Earth? I don’t. That I’m scared this mission might fail? I’m not. Or that I—&rdquo; She stopped herself.</p><p>Silence bloomed between them, heavy with unspoken truths.</p><p>Nathan didn’t push her to finish the sentence. His fingers brushed lightly against the edge of the console, grounding himself as he spoke. &ldquo;You think I don’t get it? Being out here, so far from everything that makes us human? Hell, sometimes I wake up and it takes me a solid minute to remember where I am. But then,&rdquo; he paused, as if searching for the right words, &ldquo;but then I see you, and I think&mldr; maybe this century-long trek across the galaxy wouldn’t feel so endless if you’d let me in.&rdquo;</p><p>Tamyra turned to him, her throat tight. &ldquo;Nate&mldr;&rdquo;</p><p>His name hung between them like a gravity well, pulling everything into its orbit.</p><p>&ldquo;I can’t,&rdquo; she said, though her voice betrayed the fissures in her resolve. &ldquo;Do you know what it’s like to rely on somebody, only to lose them when it matters most? Out here, there’s no safety net. There’s no room for—&rdquo; she gestured vaguely, struggling to find the word that wouldn’t betray her. &ldquo;—attachments.&rdquo;</p><p>Nathan floated closer, and this time she didn’t back away. He cupped her elbow gently with one hand, stabilizing them both as a subtle current from the ship’s life support hummed in the background.</p><p>&ldquo;Out here,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;attachments are all we have. Maybe it’s not about avoiding loss. Maybe it’s about finding something worth losing.&rdquo;</p><p>The words caught her off guard. Suddenly, she wasn’t staring at an engineer with a penchant for bad jokes and stolen tomatoes; she was staring at a man who had dared to hope in a universe that swallowed hope whole. And for the first time in a long time, she let herself wonder — wonder if two tangled lives could drift together in a sea of stars.</p><p>Before she could think better of it, before the weight of her fears crashed back over her, Tamyra leaned forward. Zero gravity made the motion slower than on Earth, more deliberate. Nathan didn’t flinch; in fact, he leaned in to meet her halfway. Their foreheads brushed first, a tender collision that sent a ripple through her chest.</p><p>When their lips touched, it wasn’t the epic surge of gravity she might have expected — it was gentle, like the quiet realization of something that’s been waiting for you all along.</p><p>Time ceased to have meaning, as it often did in the vastness of space. When they finally drifted apart, their breaths mingling in the recycled air, Tamyra let out a laugh — soft but unguarded.</p><p>Nathan smirked, still close enough for her to feel the warmth of him. &ldquo;So, does this mean I can come back for another tomato tomorrow?&rdquo;</p><p>Her laugh grew louder, a sound that felt foreign and yet entirely natural. &ldquo;Only if you’re willing to help water the plants.&rdquo;</p><p>For the first time since leaving Earth, the stars outside the greenhouse didn’t seem quite as distant.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/space-and-astronomy/>Space and Astronomy</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/wormholes-and-time-travel-unlocking-the-mysteries-of-the-universe/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Wormholes and Time Travel: Unlocking the Mysteries of the Universe</span></a></nav><nav class=paginav><ul style=list-style-type:none><li><small>See Also</small></li><li><ul style=list-style-type:none><li><small><a href=/cosmic-whispers-legends-from-the-stars/>Cosmic Whispers: Legends from the Stars</a></small></li><li><small><a href=/astronomy-in-fiction-short-stories-that-reach-for-the-stars/>Astronomy in Fiction: Short Stories That Reach for the Stars</a></small></li><li><small><a href=/cosmic-chronicles-the-quest-for-knowledge-beyond-our-world/>Cosmic Chronicles: The Quest for Knowledge Beyond Our World</a></small></li><li><small><a href=/through-the-wormhole-exploring-parallel-universes/>Through the Wormhole: Exploring Parallel Universes</a></small></li><li><small><a href=/lost-in-the-nebula-a-space-odyssey/>Lost in the Nebula: A Space Odyssey</a></small></li></ul></li></ul></nav></footer></article></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2025 <a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/>All the stories are here!</a></span></footer><a href=#top aria-label="go to top" title="Go to Top (Alt + G)" class=top-link id=top-link accesskey=g><svg viewBox="0 0 12 6" fill="currentcolor"><path d="M12 6H0l6-6z"/></svg>
