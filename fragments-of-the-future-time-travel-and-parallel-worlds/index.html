No treatment, no skilled horologist, no incantation of “damn it, not again!” would ever undo the winding fracture slicing the face from one to six o’clock. The crack did not merely mark the moments; it divided realities, slipped between minutes, and—if you watched carefully—sometimes, impossibly, made seconds leap.</p><p>He discovered this on a Tuesday.</p><p>“Right on time,” his girlfriend Alice announced, snapping her book closed as Milo scuffed into their favorite coffee shop, the watch humming at his wrist.</p><p>He raised an eyebrow. “Right on whose time?”</p><p>Alice smirked, catching the joke, since Milo, meant to arrive at four, always sauntered in at six (or, as her bookish sense of humor called it, 1800 hours in a parallel world where lateness was punctuality).</p><p>He twisted the cracked watch unconsciously, feeling the odd buzz flutter through his arm. He didn’t yet know what the vibration signified. Neither of them did.</p><h3 id=the-incident>The Incident</h3><p>Later that week, Milo, hunched over his drawing board, tried to finish an overdue architecture submission. Deadline: eleven. The second hand ticked toward 10:54 PM. Six minutes. He squeezed out a few more lines, fighting that old dread—six minutes, less. Blinking hard, Milo saw the crack glint; the hands leaped. 10:54 PM became 11:12 PM.</p><p>His chest seized with panic. The file was saved, timestamped. He’d—somehow—lost time.</p><p>Or had he skipped it?</p><p>He sent his files, pounding the keys, and sat back bewildered. Surely, it was exhaustion. Surely not lost, not skipped—not—a word he circled in his mind—traveled.</p><h3 id=the-discrepancies>The Discrepancies</h3><p>He would have let it go if not for the incidents multiplying. Time stuttered when he wore the watch, always when he needed it least: waiting for his tea to brew, the kettle fizzed from 3:07 to 3:11 in a second. The evening news became soundbites. Even his cat, Rimbaud, blinked in and out of rooms impossibly fast.</p><p>Milo tried going without the watch. He arrived everywhere at odd times, unsure how long anything took.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re out of sync,&rdquo; said Alice one morning, exasperated as they crossed a street, he waiting for a green light that never came, she ready to jaywalk into what seemed a trafficless void to her. Time branched around Milo; her timeline, he started to suspect, diverged from his by increments that only the cracked, humming watch could explain.</p><h3 id=the-archivist>The Archivist</h3><p>After a restless night—dreams of corridors stacked with ticking clocks, each displaying a universe—Milo found himself at the old library. He didn’t remember walking there. Perhaps the watch had nudged him in the direction of truth.</p><p>Behind a pile of yellowed manuscripts, a man reading a battered quantum physics journal peered over round spectacles. “Looking for answers?” the man rasped, fixing Milo with a knowing glare.</p><p>“My watch—” Milo hesitated.</p><p>“You skipped here,” the man supplied, closing the journal and countering Milo’s uncertainty. “Fragments. It happens with artifacts left half-fixed between possibilities.”</p><p>The word artifact sounded absurd, but discomfort nagged Milo’s side. “You know about this?”</p><p>“I know you’re not the first. Or even the best prepared,” said the man, who introduced himself as Harrington, the Archivist. He gestured to sit, thrumming fingers on the table as if keeping pace with metronomes only audible to him.</p><p>“Time’s less a river, more a shattered pane,” said Harrington, “and sometimes those cracks let us slip sideways—parallel timelines, not just into moments ahead or behind, but into whole other futures or pasts branching off your own.”</p><p>Milo’s disbelief caved beneath the evidence of his skipping days.</p><p>“Some get lost,” Harrington continued, “looping, reliving. Others clutch fragments—a cracked watch, broken camera, once even a pair of shoes—that shuttle them across diverging strands. Most get stuck.”</p><p>“But—what’s the point?” Milo asked. “Are we supposed to fix something? Or is it all just—noise?”</p><p>Harrington gave a wan smile. “We are stories, written and rewritten. Every time you skip, you’re reading another draft.”</p><h3 id=collisions>Collisions</h3><p>The days bled strangely. Sometimes Alice greeted him with stories he couldn’t recall—days out, fights over small things, affections that waxed and waned as if she’d rehearsed them with another Milo entirely. The world felt less stable, not entirely his.</p><p>One night, as a thunderstorm shook the city, Milo sat hunched at his desk, watch off, hands trembling. He finished a new design, one he didn’t remember starting, the veneer of another future laced within each line.</p><p>He blinked, and he was at the coffee shop—mid-conversation, Alice’s hair the wrong shade, voice pitched wrong, but warm and familiar. “You’re back,” she said, not missing a beat.</p><p>“What do you mean?” Milo asked, uncertain if he was dreaming, skipping, looping, or simply breaking down.</p><p>“You look at me like you’ve lost something,” she said softly.</p><h3 id=revelations>Revelations</h3><p>Milo confronted Harrington again. “I can’t stay fixed. Every time I try, the watch pulls. Alice isn’t always Alice. I’m not always me.”</p><p>Harrington shrugged. “You’re not the same Milo each branch. None of us are. But the cracks—” he tapped the journal “—let you glimpse what might be, and what you could be. The trick: learn to carry their lessons, not their weight.”</p><p>Milo saw then that each leap forwarded (or reversed) not only time, but choices. Some timelines grew sharper, more likely; others faded, unfinished drafts he’d never fully inhabit but could learn from.</p><p>“I don’t want to lose myself,” he whispered.</p><p>“Then become someone worth finding each time,” the Archivist replied.</p><h3 id=out-of-time>Out of Time</h3><p>The watch’s crack deepened, and Milo felt the world shimmer around him. He lived a thousand variations: cities where the rain never stopped, coffee shops merged with bookstores, Alice whose laughter was lost to silence or amplified by joy. Rimbaud, in one life, died early; in another, became a fat monarch reigning in a lush garden Milo never planted before.</p><p>With every leap, Milo let go—of certainty, of fear, of the fiction that any moment was the “right” one. He saw life in patterns, the beauty of rough drafts and revisions.</p><p>He no longer flinched at the skips. He entered conversations aware he might have missed a branch. He told Alice—every Alice—that he loved her, sometimes for the first time, sometimes for the last, sometimes just for the fragile now between branches.</p><p>He even learned to set the watch aside.</p><h3 id=the-parallel-home>The Parallel Home</h3><p>When Milo finally stopped skipping, he found himself back at the coffee shop, sun setting in an impossible gold. Alice closed her book and, looking up, asked, “Well? Did you learn anything in all those skipped chapters?”</p><p>Milo smiled. “Every life is a fragment of the future. We’re all just piecing it together as we go. I’d rather build mine with you—every version, every possibility.”</p><p>She reached out, her hand warm and real across the table. The watch lay silent at his wrist—not broken now, but whole, its crack sealed not by glue or magic but by acceptance.</p><p>They left together, stepping out into a city not entirely as they remembered, but finally, unmistakably theirs—a future shaped, not by the seconds that slipped away, but by the choices they made each time worlds diverged.</p><hr><h3 id=seo-relevant-keywords-used-naturally>SEO-relevant keywords used naturally:</h3><p>time travel, parallel worlds, alternate timelines, future possibilities, branching realities, artifact, skipping through time, multidimensional storytelling, alternate futures, temporal anomalies, fractured time, choices and consequences, possible universes</p><hr><p>This story explores the heart of time travel and parallel worlds—how every outcome, every leap, is a lesson, not just an escape, and how fragments of countless futures come together in the people and moments we choose, again and again.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/time-travel-and-alternate-realities/>Time Travel and Alternate Realities</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/fragments-of-futures-short-stories-on-time-travel-and-alternate-realities/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Fragments of Futures: Short Stories on Time Travel and Alternate Realities</span>
