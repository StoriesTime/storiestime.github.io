The grand old building, with its faded red-brick exterior and large, looming windows, looked like something pulled from the pages of a forgotten history. Despite its once-grand appearance, the hotel had fallen on hard times. The exterior was weathered, and the heavy iron gates creaked under the strain of age.</p><p>It was meant to be an ordinary business trip, one where Emily would stay at the Weatherfield Hotel for a week of seminars and networking. What none of the attendees knew was that Room 213—an unassuming, second-floor room—had a reputation, one that would challenge their beliefs, test their courage, and change their lives forever.</p><hr><h2 id=the-arrival>The Arrival</h2><p>As Emily stepped through the hotel’s front doors, a strange sense of unease settled over her. It wasn’t the grandeur of the old hotel that felt off; it was something more subtle, like a shadow hanging in the air. The lobby, though elegantly adorned with vintage furniture and rich mahogany paneling, felt oppressive. The ceiling was high, and the faint smell of old wood and dust lingered in the air.</p><p>The receptionist, a middle-aged woman with pale skin and an unsettlingly vacant expression, greeted them with a mechanical smile. She handed Emily a room key, the brass tag reading &ldquo;213.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Enjoy your stay,&rdquo; the receptionist said, her voice lacking warmth.</p><p>Emily nodded, a little unnerved by the woman’s odd behavior, but brushed it off. She was used to dealing with strangers who might not be all that personable. They were here for a conference, not a vacation, after all.</p><p>The elevator ride to the second floor was a quiet one. Emily and her colleagues exchanged glances, but no one spoke. It was almost as though the air around them had thickened, pressing down on their shoulders. The elevator bell rang softly, and the doors slid open with a groan.</p><p>Room 213 was at the end of the narrow hallway. As Emily walked towards it, her heart rate quickened, although she couldn’t place why. There was something about the hallway—too narrow, too silent—that made her skin crawl.</p><hr><h2 id=the-unsettling-experience>The Unsettling Experience</h2><p>The first night was uneventful. The group gathered for their dinner in the hotel’s dining room, where the food was hearty but unspectacular. There was a strange, distant atmosphere around the hotel, as though the place had once been full of life but had since fallen into decay, forgotten by time.</p><p>As Emily settled into her room later that night, she felt a strange tension in the air. The room was dimly lit, with heavy curtains blocking out the view from the large window. The bed was surprisingly comfortable, and the furnishings were old-fashioned, but well-maintained. Still, she felt a nagging sense that something wasn’t quite right.</p><p>She dismissed it as simple nerves. After all, she had just arrived in a new place, and the unfamiliarity was bound to unsettle her.</p><p>But then, it happened.</p><p>The clock on the bedside table struck midnight, and Emily was jolted awake by a sound. It was soft at first, like the creak of old wood. But it grew louder, closer. The sound of footsteps, slow and deliberate, echoing through the room.</p><p>Emily sat up in bed, her heart pounding. She scanned the dark room, her eyes adjusting to the dim light. But there was nothing there.</p><p>The footsteps stopped. Silence followed.</p><p>Emily hesitated, listening. But as she was about to lay back down, she saw it—the outline of a figure standing at the foot of her bed. Her breath caught in her throat.</p><p>The figure was a woman, dressed in a long, dark gown. Her face was pale, almost translucent, her features indistinct, like a shadow obscured by mist. Emily’s eyes locked with the figure’s, but there was no emotion in its gaze—just a hollow emptiness.</p><p>The figure began to move, drifting slowly toward her. Emily felt the temperature in the room drop sharply, her breath becoming visible in the sudden chill. She wanted to scream, to run, but her body was paralyzed with fear.</p><p>The figure reached out, and for a moment, their fingers nearly touched.</p><p>But just as quickly as it had appeared, the figure vanished into thin air. The room returned to its normal temperature, and the silence enveloped her once more.</p><hr><h2 id=the-haunting-unfolds>The Haunting Unfolds</h2><p>The next morning, Emily was shaken, but unsure if what she had experienced had been a product of a dream, or something more real. She didn’t tell anyone, chalking it up to an overactive imagination and the stress of travel. But as the day wore on, strange occurrences began to unfold in the hotel.</p><p>One of her colleagues, Sarah, mentioned she’d heard strange knocking sounds in her room. Another colleague, James, had seen the flickering of lights in the hallway outside his room. The strangest occurrence, however, came from Daniel, who had been staying in Room 214. He swore that he had woken up to the sound of whispers, soft voices murmuring his name.</p><p>When Emily and her colleagues convened for their evening seminar, a few of them laughed it off. But there was a noticeable tension in the air. They could all feel it, the presence that seemed to hang around the hotel.</p><p>By the time they had returned to their rooms that night, the unease was palpable. Emily hesitated before entering Room 213, but she told herself it was all just in her head.</p><p>However, as she entered, the coldness hit her immediately. It was as though the room had been waiting for her.</p><p>This time, the figure appeared again.</p><p>The woman was standing by the window, her back to Emily. But the room was different now—there was an oppressive stillness in the air. The figure turned slowly, and Emily saw her face clearly for the first time. It was not just pale—it was almost skeletal, with hollowed-out eyes and lips that barely moved when she spoke.</p><p>&ldquo;You shouldn’t be here,&rdquo; the ghost whispered, her voice echoing in the silence.</p><p>Emily’s knees weakened, but she found herself rooted to the spot. She wanted to run, but her body was frozen.</p><p>&ldquo;Room 213,&rdquo; the ghost continued, her voice growing louder. &ldquo;I have waited so long… too long…&rdquo;</p><p>Suddenly, the lights flickered, and the temperature plummeted once again. Emily’s breath was visible in the air, clouding her vision. Then, the ghost reached out to her, its hand icy and unyielding.</p><p>&ldquo;You have to leave,&rdquo; the ghost said, almost pleading. &ldquo;You have to get out before it’s too late.&rdquo;</p><p>With a burst of adrenaline, Emily bolted from the room, slamming the door behind her. Her heart raced, and she could hear her breath coming in sharp gasps. The hotel felt like it was closing in on her, and the air grew heavier with every step.</p><hr><h2 id=the-truth-about-room-213>The Truth About Room 213</h2><p>The next morning, Emily couldn’t shake the feeling that she had narrowly escaped something sinister. Her colleagues were still skeptical, attributing their experiences to imagination or exhaustion. But Emily knew better.</p><p>She couldn’t shake the feeling that the woman—whatever she was—had been trying to warn her.</p><p>Later that day, Emily decided to investigate the history of the hotel. She spent hours combing through old records, dusting off faded newspaper clippings. It didn’t take long for her to uncover the dark truth about Room 213.</p><p>The Weatherfield Hotel had been built in the late 1800s, and it had once been a thriving destination for wealthy tourists. But one tragic event cast a long shadow over its history. A young woman named Margaret White had checked into Room 213 in the summer of 1922. She was a bride-to-be, traveling alone before her wedding day.</p><p>What happened next was shrouded in mystery. Some say she was the victim of a brutal crime, while others claim she died in the room due to an undisclosed illness. Regardless of the details, her death left an indelible mark on the hotel. Guests who stayed in Room 213 after Margaret’s death began reporting strange occurrences—cold spots, eerie voices, and visions of a woman in a dark gown.</p><p>It was said that Margaret’s spirit had never left. Her restless energy haunted the room, causing it to be avoided by hotel staff. Over the years, as the hotel’s fortunes waned, Room 213 became infamous, and its curse only deepened.</p><hr><h2 id=leaving-the-hotel>Leaving the Hotel</h2><p>Emily’s nerves were frayed, and she knew she couldn’t stay another night in Room 213. As much as her colleagues doubted her experience, Emily had felt the presence of something beyond the ordinary. The warning from the ghost was clear: leave before it was too late.</p><p>The next morning, Emily packed her things and checked out of the Weatherfield Hotel, leaving behind the chilling room and the specter of Margaret White. As she drove away from the town, she couldn’t help but glance back at the hotel in her rearview mirror. The building stood silently, as though waiting for the next unfortunate soul to cross its threshold.</p><p>Room 213 would always be there, a cursed, forgotten corner of the Weatherfield Hotel. And for those who dared to stay, it would forever hold its dark secret.</p><p>But for Emily, the haunting would remain in her memory—a reminder of the thin veil between the living and the dead, and the ghost who still walked the halls of the Weatherfield Hotel.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/ghost-stories/>Ghost Stories</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-forsaken-lighthouse-story-of-the-wailing-sea-ghost/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Forsaken Lighthouse: Story of the wailing sea ghost</span>
