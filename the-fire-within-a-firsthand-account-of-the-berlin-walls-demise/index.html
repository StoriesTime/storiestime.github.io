They came to listen to an unlikeable man, Herr Müller, a dissenter whose words were too dangerous for the current regime. He had been a engineer who built bombs, but later decided he didn&rsquo;t want his daughter to grow up in this constant fear of the government. For this, he was seen as a traitor and had to leave his home, his job, and his family. Without his sudden knowledge and his newly-gained reputation, he wouldn&rsquo;t have thrived. The Berlin Wall would soon fall.</p><p>Herr Müller sat atop a wooden pallet, his dark glasses reflecting the dim streetlight as he told them stories. Some people couldn&rsquo;t help but observe him and not listen—they were skeptics, and they didn&rsquo;t believe that things could change. They were adherents of the idea that humans were just puppets, and there was nothing they could do. But they participated in these clandestine gatherings, perhaps out of curiosity or pure boredom.</p><p>The people were diverse—students off the street, families in shades of blue and pink, old men with a certain luminous glint in their eyes, and more. Yet common to all was a fire, an anxiety, a jumpy determination. They all had a fire within the embers of the servitude in which they were smothered.</p><p>One night, a man approached the little circle. No one was suspicious. Well-dressed and confident, he got through the so-called human wall surrounding the kettle philosopher. He leaned in close to Müller and whispered something into his ear. Something entirely unexpected.</p><p>And so it was that on the brink of the fall of the Berlin Wall, a man named Herr Schreiber had come forward to offer a proposal to Müller. He had friends in the East German government, he said, friends with a desire for change. Could he, Müller, and these ragtag groups of people help bring it about? He did not necessarily say why, but instead attributed the possibility to Müller&rsquo;s influence on these politically influential friends.</p><p>Müller looked into Schreiber&rsquo;s eyes, which glinted in the dim moonlight, as if the whole sky was coming to bear witness to this conversation in the cold, stale air of East Berlin. Müller inside was no fool; he asked for a few moments to consider, to think about the implications that these hints had on the fates of these spirited, enthralled people.</p><p>That night, as the fire within these folks sparked, so did the more apparent embers of a much larger one. Politicians dispatched by proxy? A large, burning revolution looming? A quiet purveyor of change, kulminating in what all these people so desperately wished for - the crumbling of the Berlin Wall? For the anxious, the impatient, the fervent, the notion made sense. The very concept of change initiated by surprising and
unlikely actors seemed almost desperate and plausible to them.</p><p>Though poorly equipped, thousands of people chose to believe and prepare for this triangle of elusive power, indecisive politics, and the slight, unsettling cracks which now appeared in the Berlin Wall. It was clear that an endeavor like this, destined for either greatness or tragedy, was not to be whispered about any longer. It spread like wildfire, resonating almost powerfully on the quest for acknowledgment, justice, and freedom.</p><p>The people chanted louder, with more spirit. More people in East Berlin wanted at least a glimpse of this elusive world on the &ldquo;other side.&rdquo; Skeptics doubted less, and believers intensified their longing for what many assumed would become a reality.</p><p>A small woman, with a fiery gaze and spunky red hair, was gathering names to her cause. An upholsterer&rsquo;s daughter with dreams of more than just stitching, she too now yearned for this larger world. People were choosing sides, their side being that of spirited determination and the unquenchable fire within.</p><p>Discovering her role within these events - the catalyzer of thestered awoke in her, roaring like a lioness, a force to be reckoned with. The timing was perfect - the fire was within her, burning brighter than ever before.</p><p>In the East side of Berlin at that time, walls weren&rsquo;t just what separated alleys from streets, or buildings from people. Walls in the minds of some people had to be broken, walls that had been built brick by brick by the most authoritative leaders of a country. Walls that had silenced declarations of philosophy &ndash; of the right to life and the value of determination. It was affecting groups and people throughout the city; walls were what had secluded them from new ideals, fresh air, and dreams.</p><p>Her fire was the fire within her people - a curling, imposing beacon of hope and determination. In the face of adversity, they did not waver. The fire only grew stronger and refused to be smothered. It was an escape, a defiance against what they had known.</p><p>One evening at this same spot, as a candle flickered low in the exposure of the street, the woman with fiery red hair spoke to the assembled crowd - to the people whose clothes may have been bleached by sunlight one day, and hogged by a damp chill in the alley another. They came from all walks of life, but tonight they all had one dream that they drew from the souls of their worn boots, their frayed scarves, their tired hands. They dreamt of berlin - Berlin unified, unhampered by the towering Wall.</p><p>&ldquo;Every person here, do you know the freedom we have, the power we can unleash?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;We are linked by the fire within us - the fire that will lead us out of the darkness and into a new day.&rdquo;</p><p>The first stone was thrown and the dominoes began to fall; the screams of joy and relief were heard throughout that land. Her words, the fire within them, caught the attention and support of people throughout the world. The lines in the green, blue, and brown-smattered Berlin streets began to blur.</p><p>The people listened, rallied, and fought together as one. They latched onto the promises of change, hope, and what they believed for their future. It was in these small, dark alleys where the histories of generations manifested in an ardent fire of determination and belief in oneself.</p><p>Their collective fire within radiated to the night sky, alight with the prospect of change. Every person present could feel it - the shaking, the crackling heat rushing through their veins. That fire burned in their hearts like a beacon of hope; it was bound to the similar embers in each Belarusian, Austrian, French soul, and soon fueled a revolution.</p><p>Though no one could know how the story would end - a coronation or a tragedy - they would not back down now — their fate was now a point of pride. Walls may have constructed a cage for them, but their fire was too great, in each envelope of their soul.</p><p>It was a cold, damp air about this previously brooding city, yet their fire could not be quenched - this fire within; it was a firestorm, with the ability to change a nation with one wondrous explosion of earth-stirring, fortress-leveling, world-changing power. The night had changed - theirs was one fire that could not be contained or extinguished. The people had united, and a new day had come to the bright future of Berlin.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/historical-events/>Historical Events</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-final-days-of-pompeii-a-tale-of-disaster-and-fate/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Final Days of Pompeii: A Tale of Disaster and Fate</span>
