Her brother Roger met her at the door, already three bites into a pumpkin pie he’d swiped for “quality assurance.”</p><p>Family had begun trickling in since 10 a.m., even though dinner—a concept as theoretical as Roger’s gluten sensitivity—wasn’t until four. The aroma battled for supremacy with the sharp, acidic tang of grandma’s latest homeopathic “health tonic.” Every surface was claimed either by coats, casseroles, or people with that dazed look of extended familial exposure.</p><p>At the Stewarts’ annual Thanksgiving, the parade of awkward family gatherings reached its dizzying crescendo. This year would prove especially memorable.</p><h4 id=the-curious-case-of-the-ambitious-turkey>The Curious Case of the Ambitious Turkey</h4><p>Inside the kitchen, cousin Marcy was frantically googling “how to rescue dry turkey.” Marcy, emboldened by three episodes of a competitive cooking show, had declared herself Head Chef, vanquishing Uncle Ken to salad detail—a fate he accepted with the air of a man preparing a tombstone.</p><p>The turkey, seasoned with optimism and cinnamon (a typo), had been in the oven since sunrise, roasting away like an ancient artifact. “It’ll be fine,” lied Marcy, prodding the bird while interpreting the feeble basting as a sign from the universe to open another can of store-bought gravy.</p><p>Grandma wandered by on her fifth round of checking for cats—Stewarts didn’t own any, but she insisted mysterious pawprints appeared after every meal. “Maybe they’re spiritual cats,” Marcy had whispered, earning her only a fierce glare and a demand for “less talking, more basting.”</p><h4 id=rival-factions-and-casserole-contention>Rival Factions and Casserole Contention</h4><p>As the day unfolded, rivalries flared in minute yet operatic ways. There was the traditional green bean casserole standoff: Aunt Judy, armed with her ancient can of French fried onions, versus Cousin Lisa, touting a vegan version made with coconut milk and “kindness.”</p><p>Judy’s voice carried through the house, “Are we calling this a casserole if it’s missing three of the five ingredients?”</p><p>“Allergy-friendly options are essential!” piped Lisa, referencing her deeply held belief that the Stewarts’ GI tract needed disruption.</p><p>Negotiations escalated as Lisa tried to defend the legitimacy of her dish while summoning the family’s competitive spirit: “Let the best casserole win.” Not to be outdone, Uncle Ken loudly announced a third “fusion” casserole, combining stuffing and sweet potatoes, claiming it’d “change their lives.” The competing trays, vying for oven space, created more tension than the family’s group chat after last year’s political debate.</p><h4 id=the-spectacular-spreadsheet>The Spectacular Spreadsheet</h4><p>No Stewart gathering would be complete without cousin Eli and his infamous spreadsheet. “We’ll keep things fair,” he said, flashing a PowerPoint graph named “Pie Slice Parity.”</p><p>After meticulously creating a pivot table of dessert choices (“We don’t want to repeat the 2018 pie debacle!”), Eli camped out by the desserts, shuffling slices onto the smallest disposable plates, measuring distances with a ruler. When questioned, he invoked the Geneva Convention; if anyone noticed the undeniable advantages accruing to “Chart Owner’s Choice,” they kept their grumbling to strategic whispers.</p><h4 id=awkward-small-talk-olympics>Awkward Small Talk Olympics</h4><p>In the living room, small talk reached elite performance levels. Uncle Mike, who had moved to Florida and started an ill-fated crystal-growing business, recited weather statistics with missionary zeal. “Humidity’s a real game-changer for your hair,” he told Aunt Barb, whose hair had long ago given up all hope.</p><p>Meanwhile, the teenagers, their phones a protective shield, huddled in the hallway, muttering about TikTok trends and rating adult eye-roll attempts.</p><p>“I heard you’re applying to colleges?” one adult lobbed at a hopeful sophomore, the conversational equivalent of a hand grenade. The poor teen, mid-swipe, grunted, giving a spectacular demonstration of Minimalist Conversationalism.</p><h4 id=board-game-pandemonium>Board Game Pandemonium</h4><p>Someone always suggested games as post-meal bonding. Family legend decreed that no gathering was complete without a game of charades gone terribly, terribly wrong.</p><p>Aunt Judy, emboldened by pinot grigio, seized the “Master of Ceremonies” role with the fervor of a game show host, assigning teams with blatant favoritism (“All Lisas on one team!”). Instructions were delivered with the brevity and subtlety of a declaration of war.</p><p>“Who’s ‘Deathly Silent Mime?’ Oh, it’s Todd,” someone whispered, just as Todd performed an elegantly misunderstood rendition of “Gone with the Wind.” Chaos ensued as rounds devolved into debates about whether “airplane” and “jetlag” were the same thing, and if making sound effects was technically allowed (spoiler: not in Judy’s house).</p><h4 id=the-notorious-kids-table>The Notorious Kids’ Table</h4><p>The actual children clung to their folding table like a life raft, steadily consuming more whipped cream than pie. Negotiations broke out over who would inherit the last crescent roll; it devolved into the ritual “wishbone tug,” an annual showdown where brotherly love was tested and everyone left sticky.</p><p>Little Alexa Stewart, all of seven, made a persuasive speech about fairness and sharing, but had already licked the roll—her unorthodox approach to public speaking.</p><h4 id=annual-storytimea-time-honored-humiliation>Annual Storytime—A Time-Honored Humiliation</h4><p>As coffee was poured and pies distributed (with much glowering at Eli’s rigid allocation), the time-honored Stewart Story Circle began—an exercise designed to mortify each member in turn.</p><p>First up: Dad and his “Did anyone tell you kids about my high school band?” monologue, complete with air guitar and suspiciously creative memory of his rockstar days. (No corroborating evidence has ever emerged.)</p><p>Next, Aunt Barb unearthed an embarrassing childhood photo album with the glee of an archaeologist. The parade included diapered toddlers, disastrous haircuts, and one infamous photograph from the “great home perm disaster”—featuring dismayed children and a dog hiding under the kitchen table.</p><h4 id=the-unexpected-visitor>The Unexpected Visitor</h4><p>Halfway through the reminiscences, the front door flew open. “Oh!” exclaimed everyone in unison—the Shapiros from across the street, lured by the scent of burning yams, stood awkwardly with a confused-looking cat.</p><p>“We think this belongs to you?” they ventured.</p><p>Grandma, vindicated at last, swept the cat into her arms while the rest of the family debated taking in the whole Shapiro clan (“Well, there’s extra tofu stuffing”), but ultimately decided against it when the cat hissed at the turkey.</p><h4 id=one-final-mishap>One Final Mishap</h4><p>As the evening wound down, people sprawled on couches, belting out off-key renditions of “Piano Man”—as tradition and Uncle Ken dictated. There was a sudden thud; the master bath toilet had, once again, overflowed, causing minor mayhem as everyone remembered why they should avoid Aunt Judy’s “fiber-rich” stuffing.</p><p>Cleanup commenced, liberally accompanied by laughter, bickering, and the assurance that next year would absolutely go smoothly (no one believed this).</p><h4 id=the-gathering-closes>The Gathering Closes</h4><p>Guests departed, armed with mismatched Tupperware, the last shreds of sanity clinging tighter than Marcy’s ill-fated cinnamon turkey. Grandma and her cat waved from the porch, Eli emailed out a post-event survey, and the Stewarts’ annual gathering rejoined the mythic family lore—a blend of relatable mishaps, ridiculous feuds, and moments of unlikely connection.</p><p>In the end, as dishes clattered and the scent of burnt cinnamon faded, the Stewarts knew their holiday legacy was secure: a chaos as constant as the love threaded through it.</p><p>And so, as sure as the sun will rise over overcooked turkey, they’d do it all again next year—awkward, ridiculous, and united, if only for a day.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/comedy-and-humor/>Comedy and Humor</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/awkward-encounters-the-funniest-moments-in-public-transport/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Awkward Encounters: The Funniest Moments in Public Transport</span>
