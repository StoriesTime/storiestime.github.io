His soul fuelled with passion, and whispers of his talent flickered through the town like unseen sparks of fire, igniting the souls of all who dared to gaze upon his work.</p><p>As Cyren walked through the cobbled streets, his eyes glistened with the fire of both ambition and despair. The muse walked hand in hand with him, the enchanting siren of inspiration who had blessed the people of Aventin with a gift long forgotten. It was whispered that the muse brought life to the canvas, and Cyren was the one brotherhood chosen to breathe this life through their eager brush strokes.</p><p>At the tender age of seventeen, Cyren had already secured a place among the celebrated artists of Aventin. The exquisitely fused colors that flowed effortlessly from his brush onto the canvas streaked the souls of all who beheld them, tearing open their hearts and allowing the cosmic light of divine beauty to enter. He painted love, despair, defiance, impotence, and above all, unquenchable longing.</p><p>It was said among the townsfolk that he had danced with the muse in his dreams, bathed in the rapturous embrace of the celestial arts, and trampled upon the forbidden realms of time and space. As his fame grew, so did the whispers that echoed throughout the very air of Aventin, which were of women who had flitted into his life as the seasons changed and departed much like the ghosts of autumn leaves twirling into the cold embrace of winter.</p><p>It was the fair Lily of Aventin who captured his heart with her snowy, almond-shaped eyes, two icy lakes reflecting the tender flames of devotion that he had no words to express. Their love, a forbidden fruit, blossomed in secret, hidden deep within the emerald sanctuary of the forest. And to the enthralling tune of his heartstrings, Cyren Daylight began carving into the Tablets of Time, staining the annals of history with a tale of passion and betrayal.</p><p>As time unfolded like a painted canvas, so too did the weave of deceit. The treacherous Minister of Art, loathed by the shadows of Cyren&rsquo;s inner being, cast his wicked glare upon the young painter. His heart poisoned with the vile searings of envy and covetousness, the venomous veil of his wicked desires rendered the beauty of Cyren&rsquo;s work an evil, malignant curse that befell all who beheld it.</p><p>But as the dark tendrils of the Minister&rsquo;s thoughts entwined the very depths of Cyren&rsquo;s soul, the muse, their once harmonious companion, turned as cold as the icy lakes Lily’s eyes that Cyren found himself longing for one more time. And as the whispers of betrayal hatched among the peering eyes of Aventin, Cyren found himself forsaken, drained of inspiration, and left to wither.</p><p>A drift of snow fell upon Cyren’s once vibrant soul, shed like the tears of an old convict, mourning the expiration of his soul’s redemption. His brushes lay abandoned amongst the discarded shades of colors, for the sunlight had left, and only the twisted shadows of his misery swayed in silent mourning.</p><p>Devoid of inspiration, the painter turned to his darkest dreams, where the forbidden realms of time and space flowed like the cosmic oils of sorrow, and eager to drink from the chalice of knowledge, betrayed by the muse, his unbridled ego, and an insatiable lust for power. Among the opulent hues that marked Cyren’s misfortune, the elements of darkness swirled around him, bestowing upon him their wicked arts.</p><p>Desperate for the love and sweet lamentation once imbibed within the sanctuary of Lily&rsquo;s embrace, Cyren falters in his heart’s eternal search for solace. The celestial arts he once ruled, now alien and distant, as the sins of blind ambition fed his soul to the flames of suffering.</p><p>Betrayed by the muse that had once whispered sweet dreams of inspiration into his ear and cast a spell upon his heart, Cyren Daylight, once the terror of time and its consecrated knight, now dances upon the edge of a blade, ere he plunges into the unfathomable abyss of his own making.</p><p>The canvas of time alone, stretches both wide and infinite. Let us remember that in order for some to achieve greatness, there must always be a dance with the shadows, and a betraying silence cast from the heart of those we love.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/betrayal-and-revenge/>Betrayal and Revenge</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/betrayed-by-blood-the-ultimate-revenge/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Betrayed by Blood: The Ultimate Revenge</span>
