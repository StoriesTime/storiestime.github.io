The Cultural Revolution had arrived in their home as an echo of distant drums, now roaring in their ears.</p><p>Her father tried to stand tall, a high school mathematics teacher rendered vulnerable by a thin, hawkish student in a threadbare uniform. “Comrade, you are welcome to look,” he said, voice trembling as he offered the bookshelf with his trembling hands.</p><p>The Red Guards rifled through their books, tossing volumes from the shelves: Dostoevsky and Dickens hit the unpolished floor with thuds, Shakespeare’s pages fluttering like wounded birds. Jiang, the older boy, found a battered copy of “On Liberty” hidden beneath a stack of well-worn primers. He grinned, holding it aloft.</p><p>Yun’s mother stepped forward, silent tears streaking her cheeks, but said nothing. Silence had become their only shield.</p><hr><p>In the weeks that followed, Yun learned new words whispered in alleys or spat across the square: struggle session, denunciation, black class, re-education. One by one, neighbors disappeared from the apartment block. Auntie Wu from next door, always humming old operas, now gone; Mr. Chen, the carpenter—a capitalist, said the rumors—vanished overnight.</p><p>Liu Yun clung to small rituals: brushing her hair in the morning, practicing her calligraphy, copying loyal quotations from Chairman Mao in crimson ink in a thin blue schoolbook. Each night, she lay awake, listening to the distant shouts and songs of Revolutionary youth in the streets. Sometimes drums. Sometimes glass breaking.</p><p>Her father changed. He still recited multiplication tables to her in the evening, soft and urgent, as if math could anchor them in a world swaying off-kilter. But his jokes faded, and he spoke less with each passing day.</p><hr><p>One late November afternoon, Yun returned from school to find the apartment torn apart. Furniture overturned, books shredded, porcelain smashed. She found her mother weeping by the window, face pressed into the glass.</p><p>“Where is Father?” Yun asked, her voice a dry whisper.</p><p>Her mother didn’t turn. “He has been… taken to the school. For questioning. They say he will come back tonight.”</p><p>But her father didn’t return for two weeks.</p><p>The absence settled in their home—a cold, breathless shadow. They clung to rumors from the school: he was sent to the countryside for re-education; he was locked in the gymnasium, forced to wear a dunce cap and carry a placard reading “Liu—the Poisonous Weed.”</p><p>Yun took his side of the bed, pressing close to her mother for warmth. At school, the walls were papered with posters in thick black characters: “Smash the Old World! Build the New!” Even children became informers, their loyalties shifting like the wind, but Yun kept her head down. She spent hours practicing stroke order, copying slogans, feigning devotion.</p><hr><p>In December, her father returned wearing the same gray jacket, but it hung differently on him, threadbare and stained with something dark. He walked with a limp. His eyes darted to every sound.</p><p>He never spoke of the “re-education,” pretending, as adults did, that the world was still whole. But Yun saw the purple bloom of bruises at his wrists, the way he flinched when a door slammed or when her mother wept too loudly in the kitchen.</p><p>Their apartment was emptier: the radio was gone, so were most of their books. Her father’s slide rule, a treasured gift from an uncle, now missing, likely added to the growing piles of “bourgeois goods” in the schoolyard, where students gathered to burn the past.</p><p>That winter, Yun started walking to school with Minsheng, a boy whose family lived on the next landing. His father had been a factory worker—a “red” family—which allowed him tiny freedoms others couldn’t risk. Minsheng was proud, head held high, and delighted in teaching Yun new songs. Sometimes, he whispered jokes about the Red Guards—careful to ensure no one overheard. Their friendship was fragile, forged in secrecy and hints, but it kept Yun afloat.</p><p>One snowy morning, as they walked past a poster splash-painted with the words “Sweep Away All Monsters and Demons,” Minsheng asked, “Do you think things will ever go back to the way they were?”</p><p>Yun hesitated. “Maybe. But I don’t remember how it was. I only remember now.”</p><p>He looked disappointed, but only for a moment. Then he offered her a sweet potato from his pocket, warm against her frozen fingers, and they ate in silence as snow fell on their city.</p><hr><p>March arrived, and with it new orders. The “Down to the Countryside” movement swept through Beijing, claiming another wave of teachers, intellectuals, and “problem families.” Minsheng’s uncle was sent to Inner Mongolia; two girls from Yun’s class vanished, their desks empty for weeks, explanations smothered in rumors.</p><p>One Saturday morning, Yun’s family stood in the freezing predawn darkness of the train station, her father clutching a single battered suitcase. He had been “selected” for relocation to work as a laborer in an agricultural commune in the northeast. Yun’s mother tried to be brave, but her tears stained her scarf, silent even in this most public of farewells. Her father knelt, smoothing Yun’s hair, his hands rough and chapped.</p><p>“Be good, Yun’er,” he whispered, an old endearment. “Take care of Mama. Study hard, and remember—you are brave. Braver than you know.”</p><p>The train swallowed him, and with it the certainty of anything returning to normal.</p><hr><p>Without her father, Yun’s world contracted. Their apartment felt impossibly large, the silence between her and her mother broken only by the hiss of boiling water or the low rumble of streetcars outside. School became a minefield—classmates shifted categories without warning, friend today, rival tomorrow. She clung to Minsheng, drawing comfort from their secret walks, sharing half-muttered dreams of escape.</p><p>Yun’s mother changed, too. Once quick to laugh, her face now carved with deep lines. She kept busy, sewing uniforms for children of “model workers,” scrubbing the apartment, avoiding the gaze of neighbors who became strangers overnight. Once, Yun heard her mother sobbing in the bathroom, gasping out the nonsense rhyme Yun had sung as a baby.</p><p>Outside, the Revolution raged. Loudspeakers droned through every street, crackling quotations and condemnations. Struggle sessions unfolded in the market square—old men kneeling in cold mud, placards thumping against hollow chests as young voices jeered, demanding confessions of imagined crimes.</p><p>A dull, shapeless terror settled over the city.</p><hr><p>By the summer of 1967, Yun was almost twelve. She watched the world from the ledge of her window, counting the Red Guards that marched in neat lines, the banners they carried fluttering like the wings of giant birds. Apartments emptied, libraries were shuttered, and the markets overrun by shoving crowds buying what little food remained.</p><p>One afternoon, Minsheng failed to meet her at the school gate. A week later, she learned he and his mother had been relocated—“reassigned” to a glass factory on the city’s northern outskirts. His father had been denounced for hoarding goods, though Yun suspected, simply, they had trusted the wrong friend.</p><p>The loss hit her hard. She became quieter, sealing her thoughts away, hiding them behind commended essays and careful recitations. Sometimes, she wrote letters to Minsheng she knew she’d never send, folding her secrets into origami cranes.</p><hr><p>The years blurred. The Revolution ate itself, and the city grew gaunt and restless. Teachers vanished, then returned with wary eyes and new scars. Books reappeared, then slipped away again. Sometimes, when the night was quiet and her mother snored softly beside her, Yun pressed her ear to the cold pane and listened to the city breathing, wondering how many families shared their silence.</p><p>In the spring of 1970, a rumor spread that those sent down could write for permission to return, “if their labor was sufficient, and their hearts had changed.” Yun’s mother wrote again and again, pages of careful calligraphy, reciting her husband’s loyalty and humble origins.</p><p>It took almost a year, but in June 1971, a letter arrived—her father, now gaunt and leathery from years of labor in the north, would return. He came home carrying nothing but a bundle of clothes and a bag of millet, as if the years in exile were nothing more than a bad dream. Yun barely recognized him at first—his face had lost its softness, his hands were hard as stone.</p><p>They sat in silence that first evening. Her father spooned millet gruel into his mouth, tears caught in his lashes. Her mother clasped his wrist, unwilling to let go. Yun could think of nothing to say, so she recited a poem she’d memorized for school—lines about new days and red suns and endless spring.</p><p>He smiled with difficulty. “Thank you, Yun’er. For waiting. For growing. For surviving.”</p><hr><p>As the years passed, the city changed again. Posters faded, replaced by new slogans offering hope. Some families never returned; some rebuilt, one day at a time. The echo of drums became memory—heavy, half-formed, floating through evenings as Yun curled with her schoolbooks.</p><p>Her father refused ever to teach again. Instead, he took a job repairing bicycles, hands stained with oil and grease. Her mother oiled his hands at night, coaxing out the pain. Yun watched them, uncertain if these two tired people were her real parents, or actors in a play she had wandered into by mistake.</p><p>Yet, quietly, hope crept in. Yun passed her exams; her mother was promoted to head seamstress at the factory. The city returned to life—slow, awkward, but alive. New books arrived in the mail; the library opened, and Yun spent hours devouring stories of other worlds, timelines where childhood meant laughter, not fear.</p><p>Sometimes, she dreamt of Minsheng, still walking with her beneath the snow-laden larches, the burnt scent of autumn in the air. She dreamt of classrooms filled with sunlight, of laughter echoing off battered desks. Even of her father’s hands, callused but gentle, guiding her as she traced out equations in pale ink.</p><hr><p>In 1976, when the old chairman died and the city wept, Yun dared to hope that the echoes of the past would finally quiet. The wounds were fresh and raw, some too deep for words. Yet, in the grief-stricken hush, neighbors began to speak to one another again, voices tentative but real.</p><p>One evening, as Yun watched the city from her window, she realized the Revolution had not only stolen—childhood, family, certainty—but it had also left something behind, fragile as a song at sunrise: a reminder to remember, to mourn, to rebuild.</p><p>Yun never forgot. She planted her memories like seeds, retelling them to her children, not as warnings but as part of the world’s stubborn, beating heart—a record of survival, of hope returning, one hesitant step at a time.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/cultural-revolutions/>Cultural Revolutions</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/echoes-of-change-a-journey-through-the-cultural-revolution/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Echoes of Change: A Journey Through the Cultural Revolution</span>
