She had inherited her grandmother&rsquo;s house along with the accumulation of a long, mysterious life—a place that whispered with odd echoes and secrets that settled in the baseboards. Her friends warned her about the town, called it a place for &ldquo;old souls and unsolved things,&rdquo; but the city had grown tired and sharp-edged. Alina wanted mystery, or at the very least, a good story.</p><p>Today, the attic felt like the thinnest place between reality and the possible. It was nearly dusk, with the coppery sunlight filtering through the single window, carving the world into real and dream. The trunk itself was cedar and ironbound, the lock rusted through from years of neglect, but the symbol upon it—an entwined serpent and stag—glimmered as if freshly painted. Alina ran her fingers over it; the pattern throbbed with warmth.</p><p>She lifted the lid. Inside, beneath layers of old velvet and maps covered in looping script, lay something not quite of her world: a frame of woven branches, holding a glass surface that reflected not the dust and faded light above, but a lush, never-before-seen grove churning with gold and deep, jeweled green. At the center, a circle—vertical, impossible—spun gently like a standing pool of water.</p><p>Something called to her, and Alina, ever the one for foolishness and adventure, laid her palm flat against the glass.</p><p>The attic spun away. A wind carried her name, old and new at once. She stepped through the portal.</p><hr><h3 id=chapter-one-the-whispering-glen>Chapter One: The Whispering Glen</h3><p>Beyond the portal was no ordinary forest. The air here sang with energy; scents of honeysuckle and wild mint tangled with the brisk smell of rain yet to fall. Trees arched overhead—ancient, impossibly tall. The leaves flickered with every color of the spectrum, not just green but lavender, deep crimson, and electric blue. Each footstep stirred soft lights in the moss, pulsing like fireflies.</p><p>Alina tested the ground, surprising herself by landing firmly. She looked back; the portal had vanished, replaced by a stone archway already half-swallowed by vines. Time stilled, or perhaps moved on different rails here.</p><p>She didn&rsquo;t walk long before the first companion found her.</p><p>It crept from behind a kudzu-draped boulder: a creature part fox, part shadow, its silver fur shifting like smoke, eyes aglow at the corners. Alina froze, but the creature only dipped its head. She noticed that reality flexed around it—footprints leaving no mark, twigs bending to its will. It seemed pleased when she addressed it without fear.</p><p>“Are you real?” she asked.</p><p>A light whisper radiated from the creature, more felt than heard. <em>To you, for now. You step where thought and legend wander.</em></p><p>With no guide but curiosity, Alina followed the fox-shadow deeper into the glen.</p><p>Small creatures spied from beneath leaves—miniature dragons with translucent wings, beetles with gemstones for shells, a cluster of glowing-eyed rabbits that flickered in and out of sight. Something massive shifted deep among the trees: an antlered silhouette, slow as a dream. Alina’s heart thumped; she pressed on.</p><hr><h3 id=chapter-two-the-lake-of-mirrors>Chapter Two: The Lake of Mirrors</h3><p>The trees opened around a lake as smooth as obsidian, reflecting not sky but possibilities—a thousand versions of herself, smiling, frowning, laughing, fighting tears. Gulls wheeled overhead, their feathers iridescent.</p><p>On the lake’s edge, a metallic shimmer bobbed gently. With a start, Alina realized it was a kelpie: equine, gossamer-skinned, its mane a shifting tide of silver-blue. Stories had always cast kelpies as mischievous, sometimes deadly, but this one watched with melancholy eyes, silent and watchful.</p><p>Cautiously, she approached. The kelpie didn’t flee; instead, it dipped its nose to the water, conjuring ripples that morphed into visions: a village from another time, a storm-chased coastline, a sleeping dragon. Alina experienced their stories as if they were her own—a parade of wonders and heartbreak, kindness and cruelty.</p><p>The kelpie turned one final swirl in the water: an image of a gate, blossoming with runes and stars. When the vision faded, Alina understood. Her mission was not to collect or conquer, but to listen, to witness, and share.</p><p>The kelpie snorted, then disappeared into the lake with a splash that echoed like bells.</p><hr><h3 id=chapter-three-the-valley-of-giants>Chapter Three: The Valley of Giants</h3><p>Fox-shadow at her side, Alina traversed a narrow path snaking downward into a rich, verdant valley. Here mountains hunched over the landscape, their contours formed not just by time but by sleeping creatures of impossible scale.</p><p>In the half-light, a head stirred—a lion’s mane blazing with fire, eyes smaller than suns and deeper than memory. This was a chimera, or something even older, its breath manifesting as rolling cloud banks. Around its paws, tiny beings danced: tiny sidhe and stony trolls no bigger than pinecones, and beneath its gaze the ground itself seemed to humble.</p><p>Alina bowed, the act instinctive. Her fear, tangible in her chest, was joined and then soothed by a sense of awe.</p><p>The giant’s voice boomed, hurried by centuries, slowed by wisdom. <em>What do you seek in the land of waking dreams?</em></p><p>“I don’t know,” Alina confessed, honesty less a choice than a spell. “Stories, maybe. To see what’s possible.”</p><p>The chimera considered, a rumble trembling through the valley floor. <em>To see is to change. You tamper with myths, and myths tamper with you.</em></p><p>Warm wind swept through the grass, heavy with golden pollen and promise. Alina felt lighter, changed. She asked permission to climb the monster’s shoulder, and it obliged—her hands sliding over fur that sparked and smoked like a bonfire.</p><p>From here, she viewed impossible vistas: aerial islands suspended on thunderclouds, mountains carved with cyclopean faces, strange cities flickering on the horizon, each promising new encounters.</p><hr><h3 id=chapter-four-the-labyrinth-wood>Chapter Four: The Labyrinth Wood</h3><p>Unsure whether it was hours or eons, Alina left the valley and entered a wood so dense, even sunlight forgot its way. The ground twisted with roots forming archways and tunnels. Up ahead, laughter echoed—not malicious, but wild, like a child taunting the wind.</p><p>At its center, she found a clearing illuminated by hundreds of floating crystals, humming low and sweetly. Here waited a creature even the bravest storytellers had only dared to hint at—a sphinx, its lion’s body coiled serpentine and languid, human face smiling with secrets. Its eyes bled into midnight.</p><p>Without preamble, the sphinx posed a riddle. Not about numbers or objects, but about intention, dreams, and the echoing consequences of choices. The answer, Alina realized, was not a word but an act—a memory she gave up, something precious. In return, the path forward untangled. The sphinx purred, patted her head, and watched her depart.</p><p>Leaving hadn&rsquo;t given her answers, but instead more questions—and a lighter heart.</p><hr><h3 id=chapter-five-the-citadel-unseen>Chapter Five: The Citadel Unseen</h3><p>Her next steps drew her to a fortress built not of stone or wood, but of time—layered with decades, aspirations, lost folk songs. Above its gates perched a roc whose feathers shimmered with clouds, whose eyes reflected thunder.</p><p>A crowd gathered inside: unicorns, their horns refracting moonlight into rainbows; thunderbirds with wingspan enough to shadow cities; will-o’-wisps dancing among water nymphs; a wizened kraken contented in a massive crystal basin; even ghosts of ancient gods, their forms shifting, uncertain.</p><p>Each challenged Alina differently: a unicorn asked for trust in what could not be proven, a will-o’-wisp for a simple kindness offered with no hope of return. She gave, and in return, the creatures offered their stories—not of grandeur, but of worry, longing, of what it felt like to become myth and then memory.</p><p>They pressed tokens into her hand: a scale, a feather, a sprig of half-remembered herb. Alina realized she carried these not as souvenirs but as reminders—a way to keep her experiences alive, before the waking world demanded her back.</p><hr><h3 id=chapter-six-returning>Chapter Six: Returning</h3><p>At the citadel’s highest window, Alina spied a gate of light—a return path. The fox-shadow, now as real as breath, nuzzled her hand. “You may go, but you take us with you,” it whispered, before unraveling into a glimmer and vanishing.</p><p>She turned her tokens over, each humming faintly with power and story. The air ahead thickened, crackling—her invitation back to the attic’s dry silence or forward into oblivion.</p><p>Alina made her choice. She stepped through the portal.</p><hr><h3 id=epilogue-the-world-reenvisioned>Epilogue: The World Reenvisioned</h3><p>Awake in the attic once more, she found the glass frame dull, the stone archway lost behind time. Her house felt smaller, but the universe larger inside her. Alina walked her streets as a changed soul, seeing the possibility of magic in every puddle, each bird, the curve of each branch.</p><p>Whenever she dreamed, the fox-shadow laughed beside her. On the edge of sleep, the chimera rumbled in distant thunder, the sphinx whispered riddles, the kelpie’s song echoed from every lake.</p><p>Alina became a collector of stories, the keeper of wonder. Children and wanderers knocked on her door, drawn by the scent of oddity and hope. She told her tales, never quite the same way twice, and in sharing them, kept the portal alive—for herself, and for all who ever dare to look for legend in the lull between light and shadow.</p><hr><p><strong>The worlds beyond are never so far away as we imagine; sometimes, all you need is a moment’s curiosity, and a trunk half-open to let them out.</strong></p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/mystical-creatures/>Mystical Creatures</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/through-the-mists-of-time-encounters-with-the-ancient-dragons/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Through the Mists of Time: Encounters with the Ancient Dragons</span>
