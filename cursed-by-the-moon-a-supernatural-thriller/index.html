She laughed at old folklore and waved away whispered tales shared in small-town diners, dismissing them as misinterpretations of coincidence or overactive imaginations. Growing up in Wolfpine—a town tucked deep in the shadow of the Rockies—she heard enough ghost stories to fill a library. Most ended the same way: warnings about the moon and what lay beneath its glow. But Cassidy, pragmatic to the core, wrote them off. Science, she believed, had answers to all mysteries.</p><p>That was until the night the moon betrayed her.</p><hr><p>The air was crisp as Cassidy stood on her cabin’s porch, her breath forming fleeting clouds that dissolved in the icy stillness. The moon hung high above the trees, enormous and unnervingly bright. It was the end of December, the last full moon of the year, and the snow on the ground glistened like spilled diamonds beneath its light.</p><p>She’d spent the day hiking, her boots crunching across the frozen ground as she sought solitude in the wilderness. She always came back to Wolfpine over the holidays, drawn more by the familiarity of its isolation than any family ties. The town itself was little more than a string of weather-worn buildings lining a few winding roads. Its charm lay in what surrounded it: miles and miles of untouched forest.</p><p>Wolfpine might have been uneventful, were it not for its peculiar relationship with the moon. Folklore in the town stretched back centuries, older than its first settlers, older than the Indigenous people who warned against staying too long beneath the moonlight. &ldquo;It watches,&rdquo; elders would say. &ldquo;It chooses.&rdquo;</p><p>Cassidy&rsquo;s logical mind dismissed it all. But even as she shivered now, something tickled at the edge of her awareness—a sense of unease. She brushed it off as the absurdity of returning to a place filled with superstition.</p><p>Inside the cabin, she lit the fireplace, throwing in an extra log for warmth as it crackled to life. Closing the window curtains, Cassidy ignored the way the light from the moon tried to seep in through the edges. Sleep came slowly that night, her dreams tangled in visions of shadowy silhouettes and the howling of wolves that echoed unnaturally, as if carried not by the air but by the moonlight itself.</p><hr><p>She woke with a jolt, drenched in sweat despite the room being freezing. Her pulse throbbed in her temples, and a strange taste lingered in her mouth—metallic, like copper. The fire had died overnight, leaving the cabin cocooned in silence. The curtains remained shut, blocking any view of the moon, but its energy seemed to linger anyway, oppressive and heavy.</p><p>Just as Cassidy swung her legs to the floor to shake off her uneasy rest, she heard it—the low growl. At first, she thought it was the wind cutting through the trees outside, but then it came again, too guttural to be the weather. It originated from somewhere deep in the woods, the sound reverberating through the silence. It raised every hair on her body.</p><p>Wolfpine was prime territory for wolves, but this was different. The growl was resonant, unnatural.</p><p>&ldquo;It’s just a dream,&rdquo; she whispered to herself, though her voice wavered. But when the growl came again, she couldn’t ignore the prickle of danger running up her spine. Something was out there.</p><hr><p>Cassidy spent the next day trying to shake the events of the night. Hiking usually calmed her, but the air seemed heavier in the forest, and the trees felt impossibly tall, leaning over her in silent warning. On the trail, she passed a group of hunters decked in camouflage, their faces grim as they exchanged low, urgent tones. One of the men gave her a cautious nod.</p><p>“Watch yourself, miss,” he said, his voice gravelly and laced with unease. “Somethin’ strange stirring out here. The kind of thing that makes smart people stay home.”</p><p>“I’m planning to keep to the trails,” Cassidy replied, her tone friendly but aloof. If they were going to feed her yet another story about cursed moons and forest spirits, she wasn’t having any of it.</p><p>“You see the moon last night?” another hunter chimed in. He sounded younger, less grizzled, but no less serious. “Full, bright, almost&mldr; wrong. That’s how it starts.”</p><p>Cassidy forced a polite smile, murmured a noncommittal “Thanks for the warning,” and kept walking. But as the group moved further down the trail, their words clung to her.</p><hr><p>By the evening, a snowstorm set in. She was back in her cabin, bundled up by the fire with coffee in hand, when a pounding knock jolted her upright.</p><p>Cassidy glanced at the door, her heartbeat quickening. It wasn’t the kind of knock that suggested a casual visit. Steady, urgent, and loud enough to echo through the cabin, it commanded her attention. Reluctantly, she set her mug aside and cautiously approached.</p><p>When she opened it, the cold air hit her like a slap, and standing on her porch was Nolan Drake.</p><p>Nolan had been a fixture in Wolfpine since Cassidy’s childhood. Older by several years, he’d been out of school by the time Cassidy was in middle grade, his name spoken in hushed tones after his parents disappeared during a summer camping trip. Nolan stayed around Wolfpine afterward, largely keeping to himself. As far as Cassidy knew, he lived off the grid, deeper in the woods than anyone dared go.</p><p>“Nolan?” she asked, baffled by his sudden appearance.</p><p>He didn’t wait for her to invite him in. He stepped past her, shaking off snow and glancing rapidly around the cabin like he expected something to leap out from the shadows.</p><p>“Close the door,” he said.</p><p>“Excuse me?” Cassidy crossed her arms. “What are you doing here?”</p><p>“Close the door,” Nolan repeated firmly, his tone leaving no room for argument.</p><hr><p>Ten minutes later, after a lot of glaring and protesting on Cassidy’s part, Nolan stood by her window, peering out between the curtains. He remained wide-eyed and tense, his jaw set.</p><p>“You shouldn’t have come back here,” he said at last. His voice was low, like he expected unseen ears to listen in.</p><p>He turned toward her. “You’ve felt it, haven’t you? The heaviness. The sense that something’s watching.”</p><p>Cassidy snorted, trying to summon the skepticism that usually came so easily. “What are you, a psychic now?”</p><p>“You can mock me all you want, but that won’t change the fact that it’s real this time.” Nolan stepped closer, his pale green eyes intense. “The moon doesn’t just light these woods up, Cassidy—it shifts them. It shifts us.”</p><p>A nervous laugh escaped her throat. “Nolan, seriously, what are you—”</p><p>His hand shot out, yanking up her sleeve before she could stop him. Cassidy let out a gasp. On her forearm, just above her wrist, was a strange marking carved into her skin. It hadn’t been there the day before. At first glance, it looked like scar tissue in the shape of a crescent moon, but the edges glowed faintly, as though imbued with a strange luminescence from within.</p><p>“Who put this on you?” Nolan demanded.</p><p>“No one,” Cassidy stammered, her voice barely a whisper. “I didn’t—I mean, I don’t remember—”</p><p>“You don’t remember because you didn’t choose it,” Nolan interrupted, his voice sharp. “It chose you.”</p><hr><p>The snowstorm grew worse, whipping wind against the walls of the cabin as Nolan finally began explaining what he knew—or at least what he claimed to know. The moon’s influence, he said, wasn’t just some rural tale. It was a force as old as time, connected to the land Wolfpine sat on.</p><p>“Every few decades, it picks someone,” Nolan said. “Someone it marks. Most don’t survive the full cycle.”</p><p>“What cycle?” Cassidy demanded.</p><p>Nolan’s face darkened. “You’ve got three days. The marking—it binds you to the moon. On the third night, the transformation begins.”</p><p>The words sounded insane, but that didn’t stop Cassidy’s pulse from quickening. “Transformation into what?” she asked.</p><p>But she already knew. The crescents carved into her skin, the wolves that howled louder with every breath of moonlight, the unease that coiled tighter around her with each passing hour—it was all leading to something primal. Something ancient. Something inescapable.</p><hr><p>The next few days were a blur of frantic research, paranoia, and a growing sense of helplessness. By the final night, Cassidy could feel the shift inside her—a restless energy that thrummed at the base of her skull, tugging her toward the wilderness.</p><p>The moon, full and terrible, beckoned.</p><p>Nolan tried to help, tried to stop her from leaving the cabin, but when the final howls broke through the night, Cassidy’s body moved as though possessed. The last rational thought she had before darkness overtook her was simple and chilling: the moon never asks permission.</p><p>It just takes.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/supernatural-and-paranormal/>Supernatural and Paranormal</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/cursed-by-shadows-a-paranormal-horror/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Cursed by Shadows: A Paranormal Horror</span>
