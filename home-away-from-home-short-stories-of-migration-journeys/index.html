It wasn’t a sudden event, not one of those dramatic moments people speak of in movies or history books. Instead, it was quieter—an accumulation of tensions that finally erupted into chaos. Her family had always lived in the bustling neighborhood of Mekanisa in Addis Ababa. Life there carried the comforting rhythm of routine: women haggling over injera at the corner shop, the call to prayer echoing at dawn, children chasing footballs across potholed streets. But that rhythm shattered when whispers of ethnic violence turned into something more than just whispers.</p><p>Her parents sat her down at their small kitchen table, which still carried faint burn marks from years of coffee ceremonies. Rahel noticed the tremor in her father’s hands as he held her passport. “You must leave,” he said, throat tight. “While it is still possible.” Those five words sealed her fate. Her mother, who had been silent until then, leaned in and enveloped Rahel in an embrace that felt both infinite and goodbye.</p><p>Two weeks later, she found herself on a minibus heading toward Sudan. Her mother had spent countless nights sewing cash into the lining of Rahel’s shirts while her father made arrangements with someone he only called “the handler.” A man Rahel had never met would guide her across the border. “Do not trust him, but follow his instructions,” her father had said.</p><p>The journey north began in familiar landscapes of rolling hills and golden savannahs, but as the air grew hotter and the terrain more desolate, Rahel realized her home was already a memory. The minibus was packed beyond capacity, with travelers spilling into every available inch of space. Rahel sat between a woman cradling a wailing infant and an elderly man whose weathered face carried stories of countless journeys.</p><p>“Why are you going?” the man asked after a while. His Amharic was thick with a northern dialect.</p><p>“My parents think it’s safer,” Rahel replied, unsure of how much to reveal.</p><p>“They’re wise,” he said, nodding. “I left Gonder long ago. You don’t forget your first exile.”</p><p>His words rippled through her like a cold wind. First exile? Would there be others? She stared out of the window, where the night was falling fast over the barren plains. Somewhere far beyond these horizons was Cairo, then perhaps Europe. Every mile was a step further from everything she’d known, yet her parents’ voices echoed in her mind like anchors she couldn’t shake.</p><hr><p>Their trek into Sudan began under the cover of darkness. The handler—a wiry man with piercing eyes who introduced himself only as Fadil—led them through arid, unforgiving terrain. “No lights, no loud noises,” he hissed. The group, now a cluster of eighteen, moved like shadows across the desert, their silence broken only by labored breathing and the crunch of sand underfoot.</p><p>For weeks, they trudged northward through unrelenting heat and freezing nights, their provisions dwindling far faster than expected. Rahel learned to balance her hunger against the small rations of dried bread or water Fadil distributed. The group became a strange family, bound by desperation. There was Hassan, who carried a photograph of his daughter everywhere he went but refused to explain where she was now. There was Leila, a Syrian woman whose haunted eyes often seemed fixed on a place far away. And there was Majid, a headstrong Eritrean boy barely older than Rahel, who kept them smiling with stories of the games he used to play back home.</p><p>Despite their camaraderie, fear was a constant companion. One night, as they huddled beneath the skeletal remains of a tree, a distant roar shattered their fragile peace.</p><p>“What is that?” Hassan whispered.</p><p>“Militia,” Fadil said coldly. “Don’t move.”</p><p>The group froze, blending into the shadows. Rahel dug her fingers into the loose sand, breath shallow as anxiety clutched her lungs. The sound of engines grew louder, then suddenly veered away. Her muscles unclenched, but she knew luck like that wouldn’t hold forever.</p><hr><p>By the time they reached Khartoum, fewer than half of them remained; the others had succumbed to dehydration, exhaustion, or simply vanished in the night&rsquo;s confusion. Rahel’s legs trembled as she stepped into the city, a jarring oasis of chaos and life in the middle of the desert. Khartoum hummed with people—some fleeing, some arriving, all seemingly in transit. The air itself seemed weighed down by stories of displacement.</p><p>Rahel stayed in a crumbling apartment complex run by a Sudanese widow who took in weary travelers for a modest fee. The nights passed slowly, strung together by the whisper of radio broadcasts she could barely understand and the faint sobs of other tenants behind thin walls. Each day, Rahel scoured the streets for news of the next step north. Through the maze of crowded markets and tin-roofed shanties, she searched for someone who could help her reach Cairo.</p><p>“You’ll need more money,” Fadil had warned her as they parted ways. She’d given him a polite thank-you, but his words lingered like a shadow. The cash sewn into her shirts was nearly depleted. What would happen when it was gone?</p><p>One afternoon, she met Amal, a Somali woman who had been living in Khartoum for years. Amal, with her quick wit and wide smile, took Rahel under her wing. She showed her the hidden cafes where migrants gathered to exchange information. “Everyone’s trying to leave,” Amal explained. “The problem is how.”</p><p>Rahel listened, piecing together fragments of advice like a quilt, until she finally heard of a man who could get her on a boat to Egypt. The cost was staggering, but Rahel had little choice. She bartered her remaining jewelry and Amal added some of her own savings—a kindness that brought tears to Rahel’s eyes, though Amal brushed it off. “All of us are going somewhere,” she said simply.</p><hr><p>The boat was more coffin than vessel. Packed with over sixty people, it reeked of saltwater, sweat, and fear. Rahel clutched the edge tightly, knuckles white, as the boat rocked violently against waves. She had never seen the ocean before, and now it felt like a cruel adversary, determined to drag her into its depths.</p><p>The journey to Egypt took four days. By the time they arrived, the passengers were hollow versions of themselves, dehydrated and sunburned. Weak but alive, Rahel stepped onto Egyptian soil, a bittersweet milestone. Cairo loomed ahead, but her journey wasn’t over.</p><p>The sprawling city swallowed her whole. Among the winding streets and towering minarets, she was just another migrant trying to carve out space in an overcrowded world. Work was scarce, but Rahel managed to secure a job cleaning desks at a call center. Every penny she earned went toward the next leg of her journey.</p><p>But Cairo was not home. There was no time to make friends, no energy to dream of belonging. Her days were consumed by plans to leave—a smuggler who could take her across the Mediterranean, a promise of refuge in Italy or Germany. Yet as the months passed, something began to shift. There were moments of unexpected kindness: her Egyptian neighbor who shared koshari when she learned Rahel hadn’t eaten all day, the Moroccan grocer who let her take extra oranges without charging her. Slowly, her heart began to wonder if survival wasn’t the same as living.</p><hr><p>The Mediterranean crossing was inevitable. When the time came, her heart ached not just from fear but from a reluctant sense of familiarity with Cairo’s chaos. The boat was larger and better manned this time, though no less perilous. As she huddled among other migrants, she thought about Mekanisa, her parents, and the quiet life she’d left behind. Was it sacrifice or betrayal to come so far?</p><p>The Italian coastline emerged at dawn one morning, a hazy promise on the horizon. Rahel felt tears sting her eyes, but she wasn’t sure if they were from relief or exhaustion. People cheered around her, but she remained silent, clutching the photograph of her parents she had kept hidden all this time.</p><p>This wasn’t home—it was another beginning. Yet as she stepped onto solid ground, she felt a flicker of something she hadn’t allowed herself to feel in years: hope.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/migration-and-immigration/>Migration and Immigration</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/home-away-from-home-short-stories-of-migration-adventures/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Home Away From Home: Short Stories of Migration Adventures</span>
