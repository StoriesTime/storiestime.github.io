This remote hamlet clings to life in the relentless grip of a merciless winter, where the icy winds howl and the perpetual blanket of snow muffles all but the harshest of whispers. Gossip in Icefall is scarce, it’s true, but as with any tight-knit community, news eventually seeps through the chinks in their frost-encrusted walls. On a blustery day in the dead of winter, word of a daring and notably unsuccessful robbery spread like wildfire, and so we bring you the tale of a frosty theft gone completely awry.</p><p>Far be it from the village’s peculiar, white-bearded librarian, Thaddeus Kinesis, to harbor criminal thoughts. Honest to a fault, the old man was revered for his ability to wheedle coveted literature from even the most unreachable of libraries, though most never imagined that his talents would extend to equal notoriety as a mischief-invoking mastermind.</p><p>The truth of the matter was, Thaddeus had grown weary of Icefall&rsquo;s overabundance of monotony. He yearned to regain the prestige he once held in other lands as the world-renowned &ldquo;Icebound Bibliophile.&rdquo; A reluctant retirement had forced him to settle for stoking the fires of interest in his meager collection of books, most of which were pried away by shivering-fingered extortion years before. Still, the glistening spines stood testaments to his passion, like lonely sentinels overlooking a tranquil, frozen ocean of snow.</p><p>Thaddeus conceived a plan to strike fear into any passing traveler, demanding ransom for the priceless tome that narrated the origin of the Speculum Inulus; a rare artifact that, upon proper illumination, could reveal paths veiled by the frost. Shrouded in mystery, the Speculum allowed nothing less than escape from the enigmatic grasp of the eternal tundra, and its discovery was rightfully met with awe. Intrigued by the hidden gem&rsquo;s tales, Thaddeus began the most thrilling chapter in his life.</p><p>Nestled comfortably within the velvet grasp of his book-lined sanctum, he set about preparing the snow-covered stage. Encouraged by congested arteries filled with the high of anticipation, Thaddeus worked tirelessly to create the semblance of a heist worthy of whispered legends. Thaddeus, harmless and unassuming, devised a plan that even the sharpest legal minds would struggle to dissect. While it’s no wonder that his execution was met with the unforeseen, it&rsquo;s surprising how stifling the fateful implications of his foolish ambition proved to be.</p><p>Even as furtive footsteps echoed through the corridors, Thaddeus couldn&rsquo;t imagine that his world would be upended by his misdeed. As his audience took form in the shadows, he never suspected that he would soon be the lamb on the proverbial tax-collector&rsquo;s altar. Those unsuspecting eyes beheld what appeared to be the curiously-intended reclamation of the Speculum Inulus—an infuriating and un-flattering contrast to the well-crafted intention that lay in the old librarian&rsquo;s heart.</p><p>Despite the lack of eager participation from his guests, Thaddeus found himself cornered; chained by his own paradox of desire. He couldn&rsquo;t fathom the actions of the robed figures he had unknowingly unchained. Thieves to be sure, but surely only after his most priceless addition to his collection. As the greedy prowlers encroached upon the cache, Thaddeus found himself feeling naive as the chained prisoners of his own making. With the chilling focus on convenience, they moved to claim their prize.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, his prized asset had vanished, spirited away by the deceitful deception he had predominantly structured himself. The haunting expression on his face mirrored the snow on the barren shores of melancholy. A bitter sneer colored Thaddeus&rsquo; visage when he found it: empty, hollow—infinitely desolate. Something as precious, as a guide to the world beyond, could have only left with one path inescapable – his own betrayal.</p><p>In a cruel twist of fate, Thaddeus&rsquo; sin cut two blades wide, deep—and callously permanent. He would not emerge from this hellish storm, yet his dismay proved to be a catalyst for unfathomable action, for the display of otherworldly ferocity in the name of love.</p><p>&ldquo;When art stolen, then must the artist reclaim it… with vigor only betrayal can scratch.&rdquo;</p><p>In the petri-dish of revenge, Thaddeus concocted a potion potent enough to end the suffering he brought upon himself. But, the inexorable nature of karmic debt invited his wrath into an unbeknownst taxing deadlock.</p><p>Preying upon the memories of guilt and remorse wrought by the device of covetousness, Thaddeus brought an irreversible semblance of justice to the preternatural world that his wanton heart had created. The thieves fled the clutches of a fury made from the same stardust that had once sparked their malfeasance.</p><p>The scarcely hidden spectacle of vengeance danced like a mesmerizing masquerade through the frostbitten fields, finally manifesting into a storm only the downfallen could orchestrate. In the cold serenity that followed, the aftermath echoed the desolation of a world unbalanced – intrinsically the epitome of a frosty robbery gone completely wrong.</p><p>As for Thaddeus Kinesis, bound by the frigid grip of his own sorrow and the cruel heat of a heart searching in vain for redemption, he had learned that perhaps fortune&rsquo;s treasures are but fleeting phantoms; his was the tale of an eternal winter swallowed by a bitterly scorching flame. And thus, beneath the frosty peaks, the tale of a librarian lost in the maelstrom of an unforgiving world found its fleeting beauty in the desolation left in the shadow of a frosty robbery gone all too wrong.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/robbery-and-heists/>Robbery and Heists</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/beneath-city-streets-the-shadow-burglars-of-new-york/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Beneath City Streets: The Shadow Burglars of New York</span>
