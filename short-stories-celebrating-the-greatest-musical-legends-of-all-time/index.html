His guitar roared, screaming through distortion, bending notes with a vivid expressiveness that broke every conventional boundary. The crowd was entranced, transported by the psychedelic vortex of sound.</p><p>Jimmy was Jimi Hendrix, a musical sorcerer whose innovative techniques on the electric guitar paved the way for rock music&rsquo;s evolution.
