Then, as if on cue, the Lantern-Tender set out from her cottage, boots crunching over the cobblestones, a satchel of matches and star-shaped lanterns swinging from her shoulder. No one but the Lantern-Tender herself remembered the magic that kindled these lamps or the old promise that filled their light with wonder—almost no one.</p><p>Tonight, as with every moonrise, little Mina waited on the stone steps of her family’s bakery, feet tucked under her flour-dusted nightgown and her eyes glinting with curiosity. She watched the Lantern-Tender’s approach with the sort of breathless attention usually saved for shooting stars or lost coins found beneath a cushion.</p><p>“Good evening, Mina,” the Lantern-Tender greeted, her voice soft as linen, her gray hair haloed by the lantern-glow she bore. “Out late again?”</p><p>Mina shook her head, cheeks dimpling. “Not late—just in time. Do you have a story tonight?”</p><p>The Lantern-Tender smiled, reaching into her satchel for the next lantern. It was a blue one, shaped like a moth’s open wings. “Every lantern is a story if one listens.”</p><p>Mina grinned, hugging her knees. “Then, may I listen?”</p><p>“Of course. But stories like these are best heard with closed eyes and open hearts.”</p><p>Obediently, Mina rested her chin on her knees, lids fluttering shut.</p><p>“Once,” the Lantern-Tender began, striking a spindly match, “when the world was very new and dreams still wandered freely across the hills, there lived a boy named Ash who could not sleep at night. Each time he tried, his mind filled with restless questions—where do rivers go when they curl out of sight? What do foxes whisper in the dark? Why do tadpoles wish for legs? He longed for answers, but only the nighttime knew, and the nighttime kept its secrets.</p><p>“So, one evening, as fireflies began their waltz and silence pressed gently against shuttered windows, Ash slipped from his home and followed the winding path out into the sleeping world. The moon, slow and considerate, watched him go.”</p><p>Mina pressed her palms together, as she always did when a story began to unfold.</p><p>“Ash’s feet led him to the old willow at the edge of the stream. There, in the hush beneath its sweeping boughs, he met a creature neither bird nor beast, its eyes made of shimmering silver. It perched on a pile of smooth stones and greeted Ash without moving its mouth, its words bubbling up like spring water inside his chest.</p><p>‘What brings you here, dreamless one?’ it asked.</p><p>‘I want to know what happens at night while the world sleeps,’ Ash whispered, not least because saying it aloud felt both dangerous and delightful.</p><p>The creature regarded him for a long, slow blink. ‘Night is the time for stories and journeys. Would you like to wander the Dreamways?’</p><p>Without really knowing what he meant to do, Ash nodded. The creature opened its wings, which were moonbeam and shadow, and with a single soft gesture, pressed a feather to Ash’s brow.</p><p>Suddenly, Ash was neither here nor there. He drifted—no weight, no worry—through a thousand doorways that opened onto glimmering meadows, ice-castled valleys, forests where the stars themselves perched like birds.</p><p>Everywhere Ash went, he listened. He heard the secrets of the foxes (they gossiped about brambles and dewdrops). He learned why tadpoles wished for legs (not to run, but to leap into puddle-worlds undiscovered). He watched rivers curl into the sky, becoming rain for new places. He realized dreams were as much for the waking as for the sleeping, and that every question grew into a story if carried gently for long enough.</p><p>When Ash finally returned to the willow tree, the moon had nearly set. The silent creature bent close again, its silver eyes kind.</p><p>‘Now you are filled with dreams. What will you do?’</p><p>Ash smiled, feeling the stories ripple inside him. ‘I will tell them, all night if I must, so others may remember what the darkness truly holds.’</p><p>From that night onward, Ash became the Spinster of Dreams. Each dusk, children and grown-ups gathered at his porch, drifting off to sleep wrapped in the worlds he wove, comforted by the promise that wonder was never far, not even in the quiet hours.”</p><p>The Lantern-Tender’s story faded into the hum of crickets and the sweet, yeasty smells rising from Mina’s bakery door. Mina opened her eyes, gazing up at the freshly lit lantern now swinging overhead. Its blue wings glowed, flickering with gentle, moth-shaped shadows.</p><p>“So… was Ash real?” Mina asked at last, her voice a careful secret between them.</p><p>“In Sorrelbridge,” the Lantern-Tender replied, “every story leaves a little truth behind for those who search. Maybe you’ll meet Ash one night, in your dreams.”</p><p>She leaned in and tapped Mina’s brow, just lightly, as that imaginary silvery feather might have done. Mina giggled, then slipped from her step and padded inside, her mind already aloft on the possibilities fluttering at the edge of sleep.</p><hr><p>The Lantern-Tender continued up the lane, lighting her lanterns, leaving each doorstep wrapped in gentle, story-filled glow. On quiet, magical evenings, if you stood just right and half-closed your lids, you’d see—the dreamways shimmered, every cozy house in Sorrelbridge a small beacon in the sleeping world, keeping the promise that every night holds a new adventure, and every weary heart need only listen to find it.</p><hr><p>The End.</p><hr><p>Are you in the mood for another bedtime adventure, or is it time for you to drift down the Dreamways as well?</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/bedtime-stories/>Bedtime Stories</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/fairy-tales-before-bed-stories-to-spark-imagination/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Fairy Tales Before Bed: Stories to Spark Imagination</span>
