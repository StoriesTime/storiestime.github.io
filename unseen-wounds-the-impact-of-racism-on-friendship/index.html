Their friendship had been built on years of shared laughter, tears, and countless memories that made them inseparable in their small town. Growing up in a diverse neighborhood, their differences—Maya&rsquo;s dark brown skin and Zara&rsquo;s fair complexion—had always seemed trivial, even though the world sometimes reminded them that they were different. They had weathered the challenges of adolescence together, and it was in those years that their bond had deepened. However, as they grew older, the invisible wounds of racism began to cast shadows over their once-perfect connection.</p><p>It began subtly at first, an offhand comment made by a stranger when they were out at a café. Zara had heard the remark, but Maya hadn’t. The person had muttered something about Maya&rsquo;s &ldquo;ethnic background,&rdquo; but it wasn&rsquo;t loud enough for Maya to catch. Zara felt a knot form in her stomach. She was used to the occasional awkward glance or racist remark, but seeing it directed at Maya made her heart sink. She wanted to say something, but she didn’t. The moment passed quickly, and they went on with their day as if nothing had happened. Yet, it lingered in Zara&rsquo;s mind.</p><p>A few weeks later, the two were at a party together when an acquaintance made another comment that struck Zara deep. It wasn’t about Maya directly, but it was about her race—about people like her. &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; the acquaintance had said, &ldquo;people from certain backgrounds always make things so complicated. Like, why can’t they just blend in?&rdquo;</p><p>Zara’s chest tightened. She looked at Maya, who had been standing nearby, completely oblivious to the conversation. The familiar feeling of shame and discomfort washed over Zara. She had known people said things like this, but hearing it aloud, in front of her friend, left her paralyzed. She didn’t know how to respond, how to defend Maya, how to address the hurtful reality of racism that neither of them could escape.</p><p>When the evening ended and they were walking home together, Zara couldn’t hold it in any longer. &ldquo;Maya,&rdquo; she started, her voice shaky. &ldquo;Did you hear what they said at the party tonight?&rdquo;</p><p>Maya gave her a puzzled look. &ldquo;What? I didn’t catch anything.&rdquo;</p><p>Zara hesitated. She didn’t want to bring it up, to make it worse for Maya, but she couldn’t keep the heaviness to herself any longer. &ldquo;Someone made a comment. About people like you,&rdquo; she said quietly.</p><p>Maya stopped in her tracks, her face clouding over with confusion. &ldquo;What do you mean, ‘people like me’?&rdquo;</p><p>Zara took a deep breath, searching for the right words. &ldquo;It’s about… race. They said something about how people from your background always make things complicated. That maybe you should try harder to blend in.&rdquo;</p><p>The silence between them was deafening. Maya looked down at the pavement, her expression unreadable. The words hung in the air like a weight neither of them could escape.</p><p>&ldquo;I can’t believe they said that,&rdquo; Maya muttered after a moment, her voice barely above a whisper. &ldquo;But… it’s not surprising, is it? That’s what people think, isn’t it?&rdquo;</p><p>Zara’s heart ached. &ldquo;I’m sorry, Maya. I should’ve said something.&rdquo;</p><p>Maya shook her head. &ldquo;No, it’s not your fault. But you know… sometimes it feels like I’m walking around with a target on my back. And even when it’s not in my face, it’s always there, lurking.&rdquo;</p><p>Zara reached out to touch Maya’s arm gently. &ldquo;I had no idea it was this hard for you. I mean, I knew, but I didn’t really know, you know?&rdquo;</p><p>Maya sighed, her shoulders slumping. &ldquo;It’s not something I can just talk about all the time. I don’t want to seem like I’m complaining or making excuses. But it’s exhausting. People don’t see the microaggressions, the looks, the whispers. They don’t realize how tired it makes you feel, like you’re constantly fighting to be seen as a person, not just a stereotype.&rdquo;</p><p>Zara felt her chest tighten with guilt. &ldquo;I should’ve noticed sooner. But you’ve always been so strong, so resilient. I thought you could handle it, you know? I didn’t realize how much it was eating away at you.&rdquo;</p><p>Maya chuckled bitterly. &ldquo;Yeah, that’s the thing. People always expect you to be strong, to handle everything with grace. But underneath it all, I’m just a person, Zara. A person who gets tired of pretending that everything is okay when it’s not.&rdquo;</p><p>The conversation that night marked a shift in their friendship. Zara had always thought of herself as Maya’s ally, but now she realized that being an ally wasn’t just about standing by in silence. It was about actively confronting the issues that Maya faced, even if they were uncomfortable to talk about. It meant listening, really listening, and understanding that racism was not something Maya could simply &ldquo;get over.&rdquo; It was something that would follow her, sometimes silently, and sometimes loudly, but always present.</p><p>As weeks turned into months, Zara began to notice things she hadn’t before. The way Maya would flinch when someone touched her hair without asking, the way she would brace herself for the inevitable comments when they entered a store or a restaurant together. It was as if Maya was constantly on alert, anticipating the next microaggression, the next moment where she would have to fight to be seen as a person worthy of respect.</p><p>One afternoon, the two friends were walking through the mall when an older woman stopped them in their tracks. The woman, a stranger, looked at Maya with a quizzical expression before saying, &ldquo;I’m sorry, but where are you from? You don’t look like you’re from around here.&rdquo;</p><p>Maya froze, her face betraying no emotion, but Zara could feel the tension in the air. &ldquo;I’m from here,&rdquo; Maya replied, her voice calm but firm. &ldquo;Born and raised.&rdquo;</p><p>The woman’s expression didn’t change. &ldquo;Oh, I see. You must have family from elsewhere, right?&rdquo;</p><p>Zara stepped in before Maya could respond. &ldquo;Excuse me, but I think that’s enough.&rdquo; Her voice was sharp, the protectiveness for her friend rising to the surface. &ldquo;You don’t get to ask people that.&rdquo;</p><p>The woman seemed taken aback, but she backed off, mumbling something under her breath as she walked away. Maya didn’t say anything for a long while. She just kept walking, her footsteps heavy on the ground.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks for that,&rdquo; she finally said, her voice low. &ldquo;But it’s not like it’s the first time. It probably won’t be the last either.&rdquo;</p><p>Zara didn’t know how to respond. She had thought she understood, but the reality of what Maya faced every day was something Zara had never truly grasped until that moment. It wasn’t just about the comments or the stares—it was about the constant reminder that Maya was never quite seen as fully human by some people. That she was always &ldquo;other.&rdquo;</p><p>Over time, Zara began to educate herself, reading books and articles, talking to Maya about her experiences, and trying to be more active in calling out racism when she saw it. She realized that being a good friend meant more than just standing beside Maya when things got tough. It meant challenging the systems of oppression that made life harder for her friend, even if it was uncomfortable or inconvenient. It meant recognizing her own privilege as a white person and using that privilege to amplify Maya’s voice.</p><p>The strain of racism in their friendship didn’t go away, but it did evolve. Maya began to open up more, allowing Zara to see the layers of pain that had been buried deep inside her. And Zara, for the first time, began to truly understand what it meant to be a friend in the face of injustice.</p><p>But even with all the progress they had made, there were days when Maya still struggled with the weight of it all. Days when the invisible wounds of racism were too deep, too painful to ignore. On those days, Zara would sit quietly beside her, offering a listening ear, and sometimes, just a shoulder to lean on.</p><p>Because sometimes, that was all they could do. Just be there for each other. And in those moments, despite the pain and the scars, their friendship was a reminder that even in the face of unhealed wounds, love and understanding could still bloom.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/racism-and-prejudice/>Racism and Prejudice</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/unseen-walls-short-stories-exposing-racism-and-prejudice/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Unseen Walls: Short Stories Exposing Racism and Prejudice</span>
