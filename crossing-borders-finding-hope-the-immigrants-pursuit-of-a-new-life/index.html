Her brown eyes reflected the flickering light of the dying sun which stretched its golden tentacles to embrace the choppy waters.</p><p>Landing in New York, Li Feng had believed that her dreams of a brighter future would finally come true. However, as she stood on the edge of the pier, gazing out into the roaring waves, she realized that the real struggle was just beginning. Her heart pounded to a rhythm that only recently had become a familiar echo in her ears, but just another reminder of how much she yearned for this change.</p><p>Her life so far had been like a slow-moving river, almost numb. Neon lights and bustling streets had replaced the glowing screens of her highschool computer lab, where static-filled Skype calls with her grandmother had previously been the closest interaction she could have to her home.</p><p>Upon hearing her grandmother&rsquo;s stories of the magical, bustling city that was New Yoe, (as the old woman affectionately called it), Li Feng was engrossed. Grandmother&rsquo;s inherent optimism and portrayal of this land of unending opportunities had stirred within Li a fierce determination that had put her on a rickety boat that had crossed choppy waters, imported misery, prayers and hope.</p><p>After months in limbo, unsure of the fate of her father, lost in the vast maze that was the American Immigration process, Li Feng learned that resilience was not measured by the comforts she once knew, but by the determination she now gathered to forge a new existence. Resilience, she would soon learn, was discovered and honed not in golden palaces, but amongst the grime, chaos, and the relentless pursuit of a dream.</p><p>As fate would have it, Manhattan&rsquo;s sprawling metropolis, however, seemed to instead wear a cruel mask that hid its enchanting glow for Li Feng. The enchanting romance that her grandmother had spoken of failed to show its face, hidden somewhere in the shadows that became her new reality.</p><p>For every stability she had known back in her quaint hometown of Zhuhai, was replaced by uncertainty. Every societal structure and order was disorganized, chaotic and there seemed to be no grand narrative to help her find her place here.</p><p>At first, she found solace in the copious libraries, temples of knowledge that overflowed with dreams of bygone eras, undying sagas of discovery, and heroes. Here she could bask in the imagined expanse of a life before she dared plunge head-on into an unknown world. Li Feng; a mere name that upon utterance brought about awe, mixed with a hint of confusion.</p><p>Yet somewhere pushed by a tireless engine, relentlessly and recklessly honed in the city, time started to heal Li&rsquo;s wounds. Slowly, tentatively, she began to find her place; a flicker of life in a previously darkened space.</p><p>Influx of people from countless corners of the earth soon brought the realization that even the chaotic New York was nothing but a piece to a much larger mosaic. Li Feng noticed that, as disparate and varied as their life&rsquo;s story were, more often than not, they managed to touch each other&ndash;an echo of a similar struggle, a vibration of a common destination, of dreams that sang in unison.</p><p>Most of the immigrants Li came to know had traveled far, over perilous borders- some by choice, others by circumstance. Li Feng found herself a part of the congregation of hopeful souls. They all shared the binding thread of the immigrant&rsquo;s pursuit of a new life.</p><p>There were mothers who left the comfort of their village to ensure a better life for their children. Artists who gave up the familiarity of their canvases in search of a stage. Scientists who left behind a glimpse of evolution in the pursuit of revolution. Each with their own tale of whispered tales and hard-knock lessons, each gleaning from the experiences of others.</p><p>As Li Feng was carving a niche for herself, the winds of change brought the long-awaited news- her father was granted asylum. With newly found determination, she started envisioning the life in front of her, more vividly now. These dreams intertwined with the dreams of other hopefuls, and the wall of despair slowly crumbled.</p><p>Beneath it, the seeds of a new world blossomed. One that spoke of resilience, of the strength of the human spirit. One that held out the promise of a future - a future where everyone could finally write their own story, theirs to control.</p><p>And so Li Feng continued on her journey, crossing more borders not just geographically, but emotionally, socially and spiritually, each day venturing further into the tumultuous and relentless waters that promised discovery, hope, and a life reborn.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/migration-and-immigration/>Migration and Immigration</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/chasing-hope-immigrant-stories-of-survival/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Chasing Hope: Immigrant Stories of Survival</span>
