The wind howled through the trees, their branches swaying violently against the sky. Raindrops hammered the windows with an intensity that made it impossible to hear anything but the storm’s fury. Yet, amidst the chaos, a sharp knock echoed from the front door.</p><p>Adrian stood frozen for a moment, his gaze fixed on the darkened hallway that led to the entrance. The knock was loud—too loud to be the wind. His heart raced, and a strange sense of dread crawled up his spine. Who would be knocking at this hour, especially on such a stormy night?</p><p>He made his way cautiously to the door, his footsteps muffled by the thick carpet. He peered through the peephole, but saw nothing. Just the swirling darkness of the storm outside.</p><p>With his breath catching in his throat, Adrian unlocked the door, hesitated, and opened it. The wind blew in with a rush, sending a chill down his back. No one was there. There was nothing but the wet pavement and the shadowy outline of trees bending under the force of the wind.</p><p>Confused, Adrian stepped out onto the porch, scanning the empty street. The storm was fierce, but the streetlamps flickered eerily, casting long shadows across the pavement. He stepped back inside, closing the door behind him with a shudder. He looked around the room, trying to shake off the unease that had settled in his chest.</p><p>As he walked back to the living room, something caught his eye. A small scrap of paper was on the floor by the fireplace. His heart skipped a beat when he saw that it was folded neatly, almost deliberately placed.</p><p>Adrian bent down and picked it up, carefully unfolding it. On the paper, in elegant handwriting, were the words: “I will return at midnight.”</p><p>The chill that had already been gnawing at him now gripped him fully. His mind raced. What did it mean? Who had left this message? And why?</p><p>The night dragged on in unsettling silence. The clock on the wall ticked away the minutes with a rhythmic precision, and as the hour hand approached twelve, Adrian found himself glancing nervously at the clock, his pulse quickening.</p><p>When the hour finally struck, the house was deathly quiet. The storm outside seemed to have calmed slightly, though the wind still whispered through the trees. But then, again, a sharp knock echoed through the house, louder this time—clear and unmistakable.</p><p>Adrian’s heart pounded. His first instinct was to ignore it, to tell himself it was just the wind or his imagination playing tricks on him. But something deep within urged him to answer.</p><p>He hesitated, standing frozen in the living room. Should he check the door again? Or should he ignore it altogether?</p><p>The knock came again, insistent. Adrian’s hand trembled as he reached for the door handle. This time, there was no uncertainty in his movements. He opened the door, and the storm hit him like a wall, the cold air rushing inside with an almost tangible force.</p><p>The porch was empty again. But this time, there was a figure standing just beyond the threshold—pale, translucent, and barely visible in the misty light of the storm. Adrian’s breath caught in his throat. He tried to speak, but the words caught in his mouth, stifled by fear.</p><p>The figure didn’t move. It stood there, motionless, staring back at him. Adrian’s eyes searched it, trying to make sense of what he was seeing. Its shape was unmistakably human, yet something about it seemed off, unnatural.</p><p>The figure stepped forward, its form becoming clearer as it emerged from the shadows. Its face was pale, hollow, its eyes empty sockets of darkness. Adrian’s chest tightened, and a cold sweat broke out on his skin. He wanted to run, to slam the door and lock it, but his body wouldn’t obey. He was rooted to the spot, his legs stiff with terror.</p><p>“I warned you,” a voice echoed, low and haunting, from the figure. The words sounded both near and distant at the same time, as if they were coming from inside his mind rather than the air around him.</p><p>Adrian opened his mouth, but no sound came out. His mind raced for some kind of explanation—was this some sort of trick? A hallucination? A dream?</p><p>But the figure stepped closer, and Adrian could feel the temperature drop even further, the air growing thick with an oppressive sense of doom.</p><p>“You know who I am,” the voice said again. “You remember me.”</p><p>Adrian’s blood ran cold. His mind reeled, trying to piece together the fragments of memory. There was something familiar about this ghostly figure, something haunting, but it was distant, buried deep beneath years of foggy memories.</p><p>“Who are you?” Adrian finally managed to croak, his voice trembling.</p><p>The figure smiled, a slow, eerie movement that twisted its features into something grotesque. “I am the one you failed,” it whispered.</p><p>Suddenly, the memories rushed back in a flood. Adrian’s mind cracked open, revealing a past he had long tried to bury. He remembered the accident—the one that had shattered everything. The crash. The life that had been taken. And the person who had been lost because of him.</p><p>The figure was the ghost of that person. The one he had failed to save.</p><p>Tears welled up in Adrian’s eyes as guilt flooded his chest, choking him. He had tried to forget, to move on from the pain, but now it was here, standing before him in the form of the very thing he had feared. The past.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Adrian whispered, his voice breaking. “I never meant for this to happen.”</p><p>The figure tilted its head, its hollow eyes fixed on him. “Your apology means nothing now.”</p><p>The storm outside seemed to grow even louder, the wind howling like the voices of the lost. The temperature continued to plummet, and the air became thick with an otherworldly presence. Adrian felt like he was drowning in it, as if the very room were closing in around him.</p><p>“I didn’t want to hurt anyone,” Adrian continued, his voice desperate. “I swear, I didn’t want to—”</p><p>“You never do,” the ghost interrupted, its voice colder than ever. “But you did. And now you must pay.”</p><p>Adrian felt his knees give way beneath him. He sank to the floor, overwhelmed by the weight of the grief and guilt that threatened to suffocate him. The ghost loomed over him, its form now fully materialized in the dim light of the storm.</p><p>“You were never meant to forget,” the ghost whispered, its voice fading as the wind howled louder. “You will never forget.”</p><p>Adrian clutched at his chest, gasping for air as the coldness of the ghost’s presence seemed to seep into his very soul. The figure began to dissolve, its form vanishing into the swirling mist of the storm. But its words lingered, echoing in his mind.</p><p>As the ghost disappeared, the door slammed shut with a deafening bang, leaving Adrian alone in the darkness. His breath came in ragged gasps, his body trembling with fear and regret. He sat in the silence that followed, the weight of the past pressing down on him harder than ever before.</p><p>The storm had stopped, but the echo of the ghost’s words still lingered in the air. And as the clock ticked on into the early hours of the morning, Adrian knew that he would never escape the haunting presence of the ghost who had knocked at midnight.</p><p>It would always return, every year, every night at the same time, a reminder of the past he could never outrun.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/ghost-stories/>Ghost Stories</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-ghost-who-haunts-the-old-lighthouse/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Ghost Who Haunts the Old Lighthouse</span>
