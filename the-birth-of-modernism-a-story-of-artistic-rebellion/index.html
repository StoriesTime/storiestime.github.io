The traditional, representational art forms that had dominated the era for centuries were beginning to feel stifling to a group of forward-thinking artists. They yearned for change, seeking to break free from the shackles of conventional thinking and push the boundaries of creativity. This was the catalyst for what would become known as Modernism, a movement that would forever alter the face of art.
The Emergence of a Protagonist: Pablo Picasso
Pablo Picasso, a young Spanish artist, was one such individual who embodied the growing dissatisfaction with the art world. Born in 1881 in Málaga, Spain, Picasso was exposed to art from a tender age, encouraged by his father, José Ruiz Blasco, who was a painter and art teacher. However, despite his talent and natural inclination towards art, Picasso felt suffocated by the strict figurative art approach, which emphasized realism over individual expression.
The Birth of Cubism
Picasso's met his match in Georges Braque, a French artist who shared his desire for innovation. Together, they forged a new path, rejecting traditional techniques in favor of geometric forms and fragmented images. This avant-garde approach, known as Cubism, was the first step towards creating a more abstract and expressive form of art. Their groundbreaking work, such as Picasso's "Les Demoiselles d'Avignon" (1907), marked a turning point in the development of Modernism, employing multiple viewpoints, distorted forms, and surfaces devoid of nuances.
Collaboration and Controversy: Fauvism and Expressionism
Picasso and Braque's partnership set off a chain reaction in the art world, inspiring other like-minded artists to explore new possibilities. This led to the rise of Fauvism, characterized by vibrant colors and impassioned brushstrokes. Artists such as Henri Matisse, with his bold, flat forms and abstract arrangements, epitomized the movement. Meanwhile, Expressionism, emphasized intense self-expression, as seen in the emotionally charged works of Edvard Munch and Egon Schiele.

The Great War and Artistic Liberation
The outbreak of World War I in 1914 presented the art world with an unparalleled challenge. As traditional societies were torn apart, artists saw the conflict as an opportunity to escape societal norms.

The artists associated with Expressionism, such as Edvard Munch and Egon Schiele, explored their inner turmoil and the anxieties of society with bold techniques. Their unsettling and complex works, like Munch's "The Scream" (1893), had a profound effect on the art world.
Dadaism: Rebellion Against All Meaning
Dadaism emerged as a rebellious expression of anti-establishment sentiment. Artists associated with this movement, such as Marcel Duchamp, clashed with the very concept of art. The thought of questioning the established norms solidified the enigma of the art- creating polarization. Dadaism prioritized an anarchical vision by thumbing their noses at art historical conventions.
Some of the prominent Dada works include "Fountain" (1917), a piece by Marcel Duchamp, which effectively ridiculed the legitimacy of art by challenging the mundane object.
