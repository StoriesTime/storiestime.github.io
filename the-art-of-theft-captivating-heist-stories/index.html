Visitors often wondered about her and the origins of her exquisite collection. Word got around about her &ldquo;velvet hands,&rdquo; that would instinctively and effortlessly identify rare and valuable antiques hidden among the cluttered bookstore. Yet, it was a secret that only a chosen few would find out the true extent of her extraordinary abilities.</p><p>The seemingly innocent Madame Delphine had a fascinating secret: she was a highly skilled thief who specialized in stealing priceless antiques from the very private collection of the world&rsquo;s richest individuals. Underneath her soft-spoken demeanor, she possessed extraordinary talent for solving intricate locks and safes, and an overwhelming memory for each detail of a room and its contents.</p><p>One evening, a stranger with piercing blue eyes appeared and told her about the upcoming auction of a rare 18th-century timepiece. The watch contained a secret compartment rumored to hold a rare gemstone worth millions of dollars. An intense curiosity sparked within Madame Delphine to take on the challenge of acquiring the watch for herself, instead of simply presenting the opportunity to her more affluent clients.</p><p>Madame Delphine meticulously crafted a plan to execute the theft. First, she spent countless weeks studying and memorizing the layout of the mansion in which the timepiece would be located. Not a single night went by without her navigating the blueprint until it was etched into her memory. Next, she contacted her closest ally within the art underworld, a skilled locksmith nicknamed &ldquo;Le F Laliberté.&rdquo; He recognized her reputation and agreed to assist her in the heist, partially out of curiosity for this most elusive of thieves. Together, they devised an intricate plan to disable the security, bypass the alarm system, and infiltrate the mansion without leaving a trace of their presence.</p><p>With the plan in place, Madame Delphine patiently awaited the day when the opportunity for the theft would present itself. The night finally arrived and, as the breeze softly swept through the lush gardens, Madame Delphine slipped through the mansion&rsquo;s darkened windows, much like a panther on the prowl.</p><p>Inside, she moved like a fleeting shadow, avoiding the sensors and avoiding detection by the security system. Desperate to maintain her anonymity, she ignored the burning allure of priceless artifacts scattered throughout the mansion and kept her sole gaze on the timepiece. She located her ingenious accomplice Laliberté who had already managed to disable the alarms, and together they focused on accessing the secret compartment in the watch.</p><p>With silent speed, Madame Delphine reached the timepiece and opened the secret compartment, revealing the dazzling gemstone glinting in the moonlight. However, to her horror, she discovered a second gemstone as she carefully pulled out the first one. She barely managed to suppress a gasp as Laliberté sized up the treasures before them.</p><p>As they resealed the secret chamber, they knew they were running out of time. The safely secured mansion had its own alarms and sentry-commando groups for situations such as these. However, one major factor was overlooked in the mansion&rsquo;s security calculations and was about to be exploited.</p><p>The two cat burglar-antiques Grace Kelly-style escaped from the mansion into the night, stashing the two gemstones inside their specially designed &ldquo;Velvet Hands&rdquo; pouches, a spacewalk suit, and their unforgettable masks. Down the tree, across the roof and over the distant fence, they made a swift exit to their getaway vehicle marked as a hot air balloon. Under the radar, they cruised smoothly across the sky, with the sprinkling moonlight glinting off the gemstones as they flew away.</p><p>But destiny has its unexpected ways of catching up. The day after their dazzling exploits, the watchmaker&rsquo;s shop was found burnt to the ground, and Madame Delphine&rsquo;s precious antiques shop was demolished in the fire. The fire quickly consumed information of the stolen gemstones.</p><p>However, Laliberté would never show his face again for the pursuit of money. He disappeared after a twist of the fate while ensuring his share through a coded transfer of the riches to his account in an unrevealed location.</p><p>As for the rare gemstones, they were lost forever and Miss Delphine&rsquo;s quiet life ended too. For she was the Velvet Hands of Madame Delphine, responsible for the atypical theft of the century that stole not only the belongings of the rich and shrewd people, but also her noble position as Montreal&rsquo;s most respected antiquarian.</p><p>The question remains - did the Velvet Hands find their reward? Only under the moon-filled Montreal sky, or in the whispers of the night, can that be determined.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/robbery-and-heists/>Robbery and Heists</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-art-of-theft-a-painters-masterpiece-gone-awry/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Art of Theft: A Painter's Masterpiece Gone Awry</span>
