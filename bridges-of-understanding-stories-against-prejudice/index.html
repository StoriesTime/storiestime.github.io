On one side of the river stood Lyric District, a bustling neighborhood of factories and hardworking families, most of whom had come from far-off lands in search of a better life. Across the bridge lay Greenwood Heights, a quiet, tree-lined haven of old brick houses and inherited wealth, where generations of families had lived without much change. Though the two halves of Rivermere shared a river and a name, they might as well have existed on separate planets. And between them loomed the old iron bridge, its cobblestone path worn smooth by decades of weary footsteps but barely crossed by choice.</p><p>Gabriel Costa, a son of Lyric District, had walked that bridge more times than he cared to remember, though never without purpose. His job as a courier had taken him across the river on countless errands, always under the weight of suspicious stares from Greenwood’s well-heeled residents. It had taught him early in life to keep his head down and never linger. Greenwood wasn’t made for people like him.</p><p>On the Friday before Christmas, Gabriel found himself once again trudging across the bridge, the air cold enough to feel like needles against his cheeks. Beneath him, the river churned restlessly, thick with broken chunks of ice. He carried a package under his arm, its string tied in a hasty knot, meant for delivery to a house nestled at the far end of Greenwood Heights. For reasons he couldn’t explain, his footsteps felt heavier that day. The snowstorm threatening the horizon made everything seem darker, sharper, and vaguely ominous.</p><p>By the time Gabriel reached the other side, the streets of Greenwood already glistened with untouched snow. Christmas wreaths decorated nearly every door, and string lights blinked cheerfully from lamp posts. It all looked perfect, but Gabriel couldn’t shake the feeling of not belonging as he reached his destination: a grand townhouse cloaked in ivy, its windows trimmed with gold ribbon. He hesitated before ringing the bell.</p><p>The door opened abruptly, and Gabriel was startled to see a young girl—probably no older than eight—standing on her tiptoes to look out at him. She had wild curls and was clutching a stuffed elephant in one hand. Behind her, a woman’s voice called out, “Nina, what did I tell you about opening the door without asking?”</p><p>Reluctantly, the girl backed away, revealing her mother, a worn-looking woman in her late thirties. “Can I help you?” the woman asked, her tone wary.</p><p>Gabriel handed over the package wordlessly. It was not unusual for people in Greenwood Heights to look at him like he might snatch the silverware on his way out. He was just about to turn back when the child, Nina, piped up. “Why don’t you ever smile?” she asked, tilting her head curiously.</p><p>“Nina!” her mother scolded, horrified.</p><p>Gabriel froze, caught off guard. He opened his mouth to say something—he wasn’t even sure what—but another voice interrupted. “Rosalind, who’s at the door?”</p><p>A man appeared, closing the distance in long strides. He was tall and thin, with a neatly trimmed beard and a wool coat that probably cost more than Gabriel’s rent. Gabriel recognized him instantly: Isaac Greenwood, one of the town’s leading attorneys and a regular attendee of Rivermere’s city council meetings, where he often spoke about “preserving the character” of the neighborhood. Gabriel had overheard enough of those speeches to know exactly how much Isaac Greenwood disliked his side of the river.</p><p>For a moment, Isaac frowned, perhaps unaccustomed to seeing someone from Lyric District so close to his own front door. But Gabriel’s quick, subtle nod of respect seemed to disarm him. “Thank you for bringing this,” Isaac said. “I assume you’ve been paid in advance?”</p><p>Gabriel nodded again. “Yes, sir. Have a good day.”</p><p>And just like that, he was walking away, keen to put as much distance as possible between himself and that pristine house with its perfectly trimmed ivy. Yet even as the door closed behind him, Nina’s question echoed in his mind. Why don’t you ever smile? He tried, for the first time in years, to picture himself as anything other than a neutral, emotionless presence in someone else’s story. The image wouldn’t form.</p><hr><p>That night, the snowstorm came on hard and fast, swallowing Rivermere in its grip. Gabriel was forced to take shelter in a corner café on the Greenwood side, where he sat by the window nursing a cup of watered-down coffee. His delivery run was done, but the streets were too treacherous to cross the bridge again. He had resigned himself to waiting when the door jingled open, letting in a gust of wind—and someone familiar.</p><p>Isaac Greenwood entered the café alone, his hat dusted with snow. Gabriel instinctively averted his gaze to avoid recognition, but Isaac caught sight of him anyway. To Gabriel’s astonishment, the man hesitated, then walked over.</p><p>“Gabriel, isn’t it?” Isaac asked, sitting down across from him without waiting for an invitation.</p><p>“Yes, sir.” Gabriel kept his voice measured, his expression neutral.</p><p>Isaac paused, rubbing his hands together for warmth. “Terrible evening out there, isn’t it? I didn’t think anyone else would be silly enough to venture into this weather.”</p><p>“Storm caught me off guard,” Gabriel admitted. “I was delivering a package.”</p><p>“Ah, yes,” Isaac said, nodding. “To my house earlier. Nina was quite curious about you, you know. She doesn’t meet many new people these days.”</p><p>Gabriel wasn’t sure what to do with that information, so he said nothing.</p><p>Isaac leaned back, studying him. “You’ve been to the city council meetings, haven’t you? I’ve seen you there.”</p><p>“I’ve heard you speak,” Gabriel said cautiously.</p><p>Isaac smiled faintly. “I imagine you don’t agree with much of what I have to say.”</p><p>Gabriel hesitated. “You didn’t come here to talk politics, did you?”</p><p>“No,” Isaac admitted. “No, I didn’t. Just taking a break from the storm.” He looked out the window, where snow swirled in white sheets under the streetlights. “You know, my family’s lived in Rivermere for generations. My great-grandfather helped build some of the factories in Lyric District. Back then, things were very different.”</p><p>“Different how?” Gabriel asked, against his better judgment.</p><p>Isaac seemed to choose his words carefully. “Back then, there was more&mldr; understanding, I suspect. The river was still there, but it wasn’t such a wall between us. People crossed it freely, worked together, built this town together. I don’t know when that stopped.”</p><p>Gabriel frowned. “Maybe when it started feeling like only half the town really mattered.”</p><p>The words hung in the air between them, sharp and unfiltered. Isaac opened his mouth, perhaps to argue, but then closed it again. For the first time that Gabriel could remember, the man looked at him—really looked at him—and the silence that followed felt less like avoidance and more like consideration.</p><p>Suddenly, the café door opened again, and a familiar voice called out: “Papa!”</p><p>Isaac turned in surprise as Nina ran to him, followed closely by Rosalind. “The storm’s getting worse,” Rosalind said breathlessly. “I thought we’d better find you.”</p><p>Isaac stood to greet them, and Gabriel began to gather his things, knowing it was probably time to leave. But to his surprise, Nina grabbed his hand.</p><p>“Are you coming with us?” she asked brightly.</p><p>Gabriel blinked at her, unsure how to respond. Before he could, Isaac spoke.</p><p>“Actually,” Isaac said slowly, “I was hoping Gabriel might join us for dinner. We’ve got plenty to share, after all, and the storm isn’t going anywhere.”</p><p>Rosalind looked startled, but then, to Gabriel’s amazement, she nodded. “Of course. You’re welcome to join us.”</p><p>Gabriel hesitated, every instinct screaming at him to decline and retreat. But as Nina gazed up at him with wide, eager eyes, he found himself nodding. “Thank you,” he said quietly. “I’d like that.”</p><p>And for the first time in years, Gabriel smiled.</p><hr><p>Later that evening, as they all sat around a warm table, sharing stories and laughter that felt surprisingly genuine, the storm outside seemed to fade into irrelevance. For one night at least, the bridge was no longer just a boundary—it was a path to something more.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/racism-and-prejudice/>Racism and Prejudice</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/bridges-of-understanding-overcoming-racial-prejudice/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Bridges of Understanding: Overcoming Racial Prejudice</span>
