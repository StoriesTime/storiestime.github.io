A carefully selected few convened in an inconspicuous building, fields, lines, and spaces tangled within their clandestine lexicon. These individuals were the cogs of a machination so intricate, so finely woven, that the weaver himself could not discern its true purpose.</p><p>The protagonist of this tale, Jean, an operative in the service of his nation, had only been initiated into the tapestry of this clandestine organization a year prior. A prodigious intellect coupled with an uncanny ability to blend into any crowd was his two essential virtues, and by his account, the most valuable of his reconnaissance was his ability to sequester himself into the eaves of a foreign entity.</p><p>Jean seized his clandestine objects, merchandised in the form of arcane code, metaphoric feathers in the gears of his mental locket. He emerged from his cloistered cell, traversing the shadowy city and filing into the gathering unnoticeably. In the midst of the shroud of studious gazes in the dimly lit room, he cautiously glanced at the gathered brethren.</p><p>The oracle of the clandestine assembly, whose name in the outside world was but a flicker in the expansive database of forgotten names, stood from his throne-like chair at one end of the table. His eyes gleamed in the dim light like quartz from his niche high up in the mountain impassable to outsiders. He addressed the select assembly with a cryptic articulation that only they could translate.</p><p>&ldquo;Brothers and lien, we gather tonight under the black flag of our camaraderie,&rdquo; he began, his voice cloaked in enigmatic intrigue, the room steeped in his invisible grasp, &ldquo;A new wave of flux has slithered into the hearths of our sector, igniting treacherous fires.&rdquo;</p><p>Jean&rsquo;s nerves tweaked, as he too felt the heat of the turmoil. The room tightened, the silence echoing whispers of the conspiracy that pervaded their secret fraternity. While the oracle&rsquo;s cryptic uxorial had infiltrated their matrix, the night began to unraveld, dissecting secret passages of perdition channeled through their tangle of moths in the labyrinth.</p><p>Through infinite nights, Jean probed the depths of his clandestine organization, gradually mastering the enigmatic language, until the secretive tongue became his second nature. Eventually, he was entrusted with penetrating the web spun by the &lsquo;New Wave,&rsquo; a rogue group of insurgents hell-bent on derailing the deceptive carousel.</p><p>His initial odessey led him to the Icosahedron, the headquarter&rsquo;s antechamber of the New Wave. He coaxed his way into the high-security campus by employing a ruse, affirming himself as an agent of entropy and bedazzling his audience with spectacles of jinxed opulence.</p><p>The edifice was a maze of individuated channels and tasked labyrinths, in which the clandestine New Wave paraded their moveable feasts. Inboxes belonging to the veil hid their treasury in the folds of uncertainty; a vast expanse of meaning buried in a cacophony of code.</p><p>Jean&rsquo;s task wasn&rsquo;t just an infiltration of the New Wave&rsquo;s secure campus but an undisclosed penetration of their blurred collective ethos. He sat amidst the crowds in the collage of the Icosahedron, navigating through news-flashing holographic slivers, volume remixed to accommodate multilingual echoes in the white-washed cubic halls.</p><p>Jean&rsquo;s empathic senses dissected the motives of his mobile network. The clandestine New Wave&rsquo;s pursuits seemed far from a simple interest in regime change. Their sight lingered upon the destabilization of structures not their own. Against the law of entropy, they sought to unravel, twist, and bend a sector into submission. Jean&rsquo;s clandestine group was more than the hairy chest of Jean&rsquo;s homeland; it smelled like an oil well of diluted motives.</p><p>His employment within the labyrinth took a weighty turn; Jean began not just to read but to compose the New Wave&rsquo;s scripts. His art cloaked his mission in the Icosahedron&rsquo;s myriad of shadows and sirens. Threading the labyrinth of the New Wave ensnared the elite in riddles that masked their chaos.</p><p>There came a point in his mission when the ink of uncertainty drenched his parchments. The New Wave&rsquo;s ambitions had propagated far beyond the fringe of his understanding. Their plan was orchestrated from his homeland, where Jean originated. His fingers recoiled from his keyboard; an icy shiver in the sanctum of the Icosahedron broke his resolve.</p><p>An unspoken alliance was cemented between the once disparate players in the clandestine world. The New Wave&rsquo;s propagation began to subsume his homeland. Jean&rsquo;s organization infiltrated his country, dissolving into the grey matter of this once vibrant land.</p><p>For a year, the plot played out under the archetypal veneer; Jean mastered the deceptive rhythm of the hidden world. But the very rhythms of his homeland began to unravel, and with each beat the clandestine plano became more transparent.</p><p>In the final gathering, the oracle unveiled what the assembly stealthily held, and like an augury, the repercussion of the clandestine games unfolded across the constellation of his homeland. The dark veil that once concealed the veiled motives had lifted, and the clandestine world lay exposed, no longer infiltrated, but infested with the consequences of its web.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/espionage-and-spies/>Espionage and Spies</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/infiltration-a-spys-last-stand/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Infiltration: A Spy's Last Stand</span>
