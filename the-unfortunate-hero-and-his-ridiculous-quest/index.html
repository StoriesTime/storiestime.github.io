Plain was the word that often came up when people described him. Plain brown hair, plain gray eyes, a plain tunic that was more patchwork than cloth. Even his family surname, &ldquo;Fargold,&rdquo; which might have once suggested some noble or prosperous lineage, no longer carried any weight. A disaster of debt had consigned his household to poverty long before he was born. So, when the elders of his town selected him for <em>the Quest,</em> Grithelm suspected it was less about his worthiness and more about sending someone no one would really miss.</p><p>The task was straightforward in its absurdity: retrieve the mythical Spoon of Zorgoth and save the kingdom of Ramshire. Why the survival of a kingdom rested on a piece of enchanted cutlery, no one could adequately explain. It was said the spoon held the power to command rivers and summon lightnings—or perhaps it simply conjured delicious meals from thin air. The stories varied wildly, depending on whom you asked. What was consistent about the tale, however, was its danger: No one who sought the Spoon had ever returned, alive or otherwise. Many believed the quest was merely a cruel joke that the elders passed down through generations.</p><p>But Grithelm didn’t have the luxury of refusing. His family, already teetering on the edge of destitution, would be compensated handsomely for his participation. If he succeeded, the rewards for retrieving the Spoon would elevate their name for centuries. If he failed, well… failure was just another word for natural inevitability in the Fargold household. So, after the briefest preparations, he set forth with nothing more than an oversized steel pot for a helmet, a walking staff that smelled suspiciously of burned soup, and a small loaf of bread wrapped in an embroidered cloth—a half-hearted gift from the townsfolk.</p><hr><h3 id=the-misadventure-begins>The Misadventure Begins</h3><p>From the very first steps, Grithelm’s quest spiraled into trouble. Or perhaps &ldquo;stumbled&rdquo; would be more accurate, since his oversized pot helmet continually slipped down over his eyes. By lunchtime on the first day, he’d wandered off the path entirely and nearly toppled into an unusually aggressive goat pen. Seventeen minutes of frantic apologizing later, he was lucky to escape with bruises and the distinct feeling that these goats were smarter than most of the people he knew.</p><p>When he finally found the proper path again, he realized the bread he’d been given had been swiped from his pocket by some unseen thief. He checked his surroundings, half-expecting one of the goats to emerge, triumphant, chewing the last of the loaf—but the road was empty. Only the quiet rustling of the wind gave him company.</p><p>“That’s fine,” Grithelm muttered, determined to maintain optimism, and equally determined not to cry about bread theft before he&rsquo;d even reached the first mile marker. &ldquo;If I can find a magical spoon, surely food will follow.&rdquo;</p><p>His self-motivation did little to bolster him when twilight fell, turning the forest path into an eerie maze of silvery shadows. Strange sounds echoed—chirps, growls, moans—but when Grithelm turned around to face them, he saw only flickering leaves and the rough outlines of tree trunks.</p><p>It was then the absurdity of his situation began to weigh on him. How does one <em>find</em> a mythical spoon? What does one do? Knock on the nearest tree and ask if Zorgoth might have misplaced it nearby? Would it even look like a normal spoon, or would it be bigger—more spoon-adjacent than spoon-specific?</p><p>Frustrated, exhausted, and too hungry to dream big, he sank to the ground and pressed his back against a moss-covered oak. For the first time, he allowed despair to settle in. If the Spoon wasn’t real—and that seemed increasingly likely—all he’d accomplish was getting lost in the wilderness and adding his name to the long list of failed heroes whose stories ended before they truly began.</p><hr><h3 id=the-band-of-misfits>The Band of Misfits</h3><p>Just as he was nodding off, the sound of hooves clopping softly against the dirt jolted him awake. He struggled to sit up, adjusting his pot helmet with yet another clang. A figure emerged from the shadows—a rotund donkey, its frayed saddle supporting a rider who could not have been taller than a child. But this was no ordinary child; this miniature adventurer had the face of a wizened old man, wrinkles creased like folded parchment, and eyes sharper than aquamarine gemstones.</p><p>&ldquo;You camping, or giving up?&rdquo; the rider asked, his squeaky voice grating against the quiet of the night.</p><p>&ldquo;Camping—obviously camping.&rdquo; Grithelm hoped the bluff would be convincing, though his embarrassed tone betrayed him.</p><p>The rider dismounted; the donkey snorted disapproval but stayed put. &ldquo;You’re seeking the Spoon, aren’t you? You have the look about you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What look?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The look of a poor fool who hasn’t planned a moment beyond stepping out their front door.&rdquo;</p><p>Before Grithelm could respond, the rider grinned and offered a hand in greeting. &ldquo;Name’s Dellwin, Bane of Spiders, Slayer of Large Rodents, and occasional Poet Laureate of Lindrand. My noble steed is Tiberius.&rdquo;</p><p>It took Grithelm a moment to respond. &ldquo;I’m… just Grithelm?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good enough. Come on, we’re doing this travel thing together now. You’re obviously helpless on your own.&rdquo;</p><hr><h3 id=a-growing-crowd>A Growing Crowd</h3><p>By dawn, Dellwin had proven surprisingly resourceful. Using nothing but a half-rotten apple and a handful of wilted parsley, he managed to attract and tame a wild boar, tethering it with a length of rope he produced from seemingly nowhere. &ldquo;This one&rsquo;s my backup steed,&rdquo; he explained, grinning ear to ear.</p><p>Soon after, the pair met another traveler: Kyra, a fiery-haired bard who carried a lute so battered it looked more weapon than instrument. She joined their quest not because she believed in the Spoon’s existence, but because she couldn’t resist a story with a premise so absurd. “If nothing else, failure’ll make for a good verse,” she proclaimed cheerfully, and Grithelm admired her ability to make hopelessness sound useful.</p><p>Not long after Kyra’s arrival, the group stumbled into a trap—a crude pit lined with pointed sticks—but none of them fell in. Instead, the trap’s maker emerged to berate them for their lack of clumsiness. He was a hulking figure named Borund, his muscles seemingly carved from stone, and his sense of humor softer than wet bread. Despite his gruff manners, Borund agreed to join them after Kyra pointed out that their quest might involve plenty of things to smash.</p><hr><h3 id=into-the-ridiculous-unknown>Into the Ridiculous Unknown</h3><p>The ragtag group meandered fields, scaled treacherous ridges, and confronted odd creatures, none of whom appeared remotely spoon-adjacent. They met a pirate stranded far inland, argued philosophy with argumentative crabs, and evaded flocks of seemingly sentient pigeons that dive-bombed anyone who looked up for too long.</p><p>Kyra composed songs about their failures every evening, much to Grithelm’s dismay. Dellwin pocketed every shiny object they found, insisting it might be magical. Borund smashed rocks unnecessarily, claiming they looked suspicious.</p><p>Yet, despite their eccentricities, Grithelm found himself grateful for their company. For the first time, he felt a part of something larger—even if &ldquo;larger&rdquo; might only mean &ldquo;pointlessly wandering toward doom.&rdquo;</p><hr><h3 id=the-spoons-secret>The Spoon’s Secret</h3><p>Weeks passed, and the group’s morale frayed by the day. By the time they stumbled upon an ancient ruin buried under vines and moss, even Kyra’s songs had grown melancholic. Yet, within the crumbling walls of the ruin, they discovered a pedestal—all too perfect for an artifact like the Spoon.</p><p>To Grithelm’s surprise, the Spoon was indeed real: a shimmering object of polished silver, its surface glowing faintly with arcane energy. The group cheered loudly—then immediately began arguing about who should hold it.</p><p>But the pedestal trembled as Grithelm reached for the Spoon. A deep voice echoed through the chamber. “Mortal fools! You think to wield my power?”</p><p>It turned out Zorgoth was no benevolent creator, but a vengeful spirit bound to the artifact. As the ruined temple shook, Grithelm clutched the Spoon—and accidentally sent a river bursting through the walls, sweeping the group to safety.</p><p>Later, soaked and coughing water, they stared at the Spoon in silence.</p><p>“I guess it <em>does</em> command rivers,” Kyra said finally.</p><p>“What do we do with it?” asked Dellwin.</p><p>Grithelm hesitated, then tucked the Spoon under his arm. “Take it home. Save Ramshire. Earn the reward.”</p><p>He was no great hero, but he had survived—and that, he supposed, was all anyone had ever truly needed to do.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/comedy-and-humor/>Comedy and Humor</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-unforgettable-day-i-met-my-doppelganger/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Unforgettable Day I Met My Doppelganger</span>
