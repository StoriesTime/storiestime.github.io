Shadows of nightfall crept across the land, but no stars twinkled in the sky; they had been gone for years, devoured by the endless shroud. Beneath this oppressive gloom, Rael stood, sword in hand, armor battered, his crimson cloak tattered and clinging to his shoulder like a forgotten memory.</p><p>No one asked for a speech. Words were luxuries now, and time was a stretched and fragile thread nearing its final snap. Still, all eyes turned to Rael. These were not soldiers who met his weary gaze. They were farmers, blacksmiths, wanderers, deserters—souls brought together not by optimism or allegiance, but by necessity. They followed him because no one else had the audacity to take up the mantle. They followed him because, despite his tarnished name, they didn’t have the luxury of choice.</p><p>Rael took a step forward, the earth crunching beneath his boots, and turned toward Ironclad Ridge. The silhouette of the enemy, a dark tide that thrummed with unnatural energy, stretched across the horizon like a sea of nightmares. Silence had engulfed their ranks, a suffocating quiet that was far worse than the chaos of war cries. Whatever awaited them within that darkness was not human. How could it be, after everything the world had endured?</p><p>Rael tightened his grip on the sword&rsquo;s worn hilt. The weapon, once a gleaming relic of a forgotten era, now bore scars of countless battles. Its once-silver blade shimmered faintly, more from the whispers of magic within it than from any reflection of fading light. He had been a hero once—or so the bards sang, long before the war. Now, even he wasn’t sure who he was anymore. A survivor, perhaps, but hardly a champion.</p><p>&ldquo;Is this how it ends?&rdquo; croaked a voice from the ranks behind him. It was muffled and trembling, barely audible over the rising wind. He didn’t look back.</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Rael said after a pause that felt eternal. His voice was low but resolute, carrying just enough strength to echo through the fragile hearts surrounding him. It wasn’t much, but it was something.</p><h3 id=the-world-that-burned>The World That Burned</h3><p>Decades ago, the world had been different—brighter, simpler. Cities spanned horizons, filled with light and laughter. Rael had been young then, too young to understand the burden of destiny. He was born a ward of the temple, abandoned on its steps as a babe. And though the priests raised him with care, it was the blade—sharp and unforgiving—that became his true tutor when the wars began. Back then, heroes weren’t a rarity. There had been armies led by kings, battalions of mages, and legions of warriors who marched to the rhythm of defiant drums.</p><p>The Pivoting War, they called it, the conflict against the Arcanum Horde—a terrible force bent on binding the world’s very elements to its will. At its zenith, humanity had leaned on its champions. Yet even amidst thousands of hopeful recruits, Rael’s name had risen like a flame above a dying torch. His victories forged songs, his valor birthed legends. But legend, he had learned, was a cruel and fleeting gift.</p><p>When the final battle of the Pivoting War was fought in the Ashmar Valley, Rael had been there—bleeding, desperate, victorious. And it was there that the seeds of this darker conflict were sown. In defeating the Arcanum Horde, the veil between worlds had been fractured, ripped open to something worse than mortals could comprehend. It wasn’t long before the Crawling Abyss spilled forth its first horrors. They weren’t merely monsters. They were living nightmares, entities that contorted reality and broke the wills of those who gazed upon them.</p><p>What choice did Rael have back then, but to keep fighting? He had tried to rally the powers that remained, but hope had been in short supply. Over time, those who called him a savior began to wither away. Some perished, others ran, and for many, the cost of admiring him exceeded their desire to survive. They called him reckless, obstinate—blamed him for his own failures. A forgotten hero—that was how he became known. The man who meant well but could only delay the inevitable.</p><p>Now, years later, there were no temples, no cities, no armies. Just scattered flickers of life, clinging to torches that trembled in the suffocating dark. Whispers of the Abyss grew louder each year, and Rael had no one but ghosts to turn to. Even still—his legs carried him forward.</p><h3 id=into-the-darkness>Into the Darkness</h3><p>The air above the Ironclad Ridge crackled with an unholy energy, an oppressive force that seemed to sap the strength from Rael’s bones as he approached. The others followed behind him in a loose formation, gripping whatever weapons or tools they had salvaged. Some carried rusted spears, others broken scythes. The few who wielded swords held them like foreign objects instead of extensions of themselves. Rael wished he could tell them to leave, to run, but where would they go? There was no place left to call sanctuary.</p><p>A thunderclap echoed in the heavens, and the first shapes of the Abyss emerged from the writhing ocean of shadows. They walked on limbs that bent in unnatural angles. Sharp, jagged edges jutted from their bodies, glistening like obsidian. Some crawled. Others leaped. Their eyes—or what could be called eyes—burned with maddening light that pierced the most resolute of minds. Rael took a deep breath and raised his sword.</p><p>&ldquo;Steady!&rdquo; he barked, his voice cutting through the mounting fear in the air. He braced himself, feeling the faint vibrations of those brave—or desperate—enough to stand beside him.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/heroes-and-heroines/>Heroes and Heroines</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-last-stand-of-the-brave-hero/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Last Stand of the Brave Hero</span>
