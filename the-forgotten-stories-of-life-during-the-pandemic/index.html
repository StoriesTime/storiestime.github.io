She’s standing in the middle of the shop, her starched gray mask slightly askew, reciting the alphabet silently as she disinfects the used-paperback table for the third time. The smell of bleach has replaced the familiar scent of paper and dust; novels, cookbooks, and dog-eared travelogues stare mutely from shelves that haven’t been perused in weeks. The city buzzes with sirens, muffled by boarded windows and face coverings, each day repeating with endless familiarity.</p><p>There are stories in the gaps, Lila thinks—stories she glimpses between calls to her grandmother, elbows aching from scrubbing, and the hush of the locked shop at closing time. This pandemic, this blue-lit, Zoom-frosted purgatory, has created a chorus of the forgotten. She collects these stories, as if assembling a jigsaw whose final image remains unclear.</p><h3 id=the-sound-of-silence>The Sound of Silence</h3><p>Lila’s neighbor, Mr. Ramesh Patel, used to spend his afternoons on the steps in front of the building, feeding the pigeons. A congenial man with silver sideburns and an encyclopedic knowledge of Bollywood, he became a fixture of the block after his retirement from the city archives. Now, he only emerges once or twice a week, masked beneath a bright plaid scarf, eyes scanning for signs of anyone. She hears his radio sometimes—old classics drifting through his window, punctuated by bursts of laughter. He told her once, in the measured cadence of the lonely, “Books are good company, Lila. You don’t have to wait for them to call.”</p><p>Now, when she knocks to offer groceries, they exchange words from opposite sides of the closed door. He will not open it. He says thank you, his voice muffled by the wood, and sometimes he slides a folded poem beneath it: always about birds, sometimes about home.</p><h3 id=grocery-bag-confessions>Grocery Bag Confessions</h3><p>Gwen, Lila’s former roommate, learned to bake bread in week three. By April, Gwen had moved back to her parents’ split-level house in Connecticut, trading their shoebox apartment and their shared midnight Netflix binges for the haunted quiet of suburbia. Their texts chart a map of longing and hope—sourdough failures, socially distanced garden walks, a pet rabbit acquisition. Sometimes, Gwen sends Lila pictures of carved loaves and home-knit scarves piled high, and Lila replies with snapshots of her cluttered counter, new stacks of novels, a mug of instant coffee gone tepid.</p><p>They speak in grocery lists, now: what do you need, what can’t you find, which stores still have yeast? The rituals of friendship slip into the fabric of essentials-only routines, comforting but frayed at the edges.</p><h3 id=benches-without-names>Benches Without Names</h3><p>Before, a man named Arturo Mendieta would set up on the park bench across the street and play his battered saxophone. There is always a saxophonist in every city, Lila believes, keeping vigil for those in mourning or in love. Arturo played for coins and applause, but never for fame. He seemed to know every old tune, from Billie Holiday ballads to free-jazz improvisations that made dogs howl and children stomp their feet.</p><p>He hasn’t been back since March, when the city locked the park gates. The bench, stripped of its unofficial occupant, sits bare and echoing, a monument to missing music. Lila thinks about him whenever she passes by: where he went, what melodies live only in memory.</p><p>One drizzly Sunday, she finds a fist-sized rock painted gold and nestled on the planks of Arturo’s bench. Atop the paint, in careful black script: “Play something beautiful, even if no one is listening.” Lila smiles beneath her mask, inhales the rain-curled wind, and carries the stone home to her window.</p><h3 id=the-digital-church>The Digital Church</h3><p>Lila’s mother, a tenacious woman with opinions on everything from politics to parsnips, leads the local Unitarian congregation’s flower committee. Every Sunday, the family would gather in a patchwork rectangle of faces on Zoom, trading tired jokes and pandemic updates. Church, Lila notices, isn’t the same when you’re singing hymns alone. Still, her mother insists on orchestrating deliveries of zinnias and roses to elderly parishioners. Every call brims with updates: “Flo Jamison lost her dog, the Bradleys have a new grandson, and Jan Peterson still hates rhubarb pie.”</p><p>During these scattered online services, Lila finds herself scanning the digital frames for signs of joy or fatigue and thinks about the ways communities hold together, even when scattered. How much of faith, she wonders, is presence? How much is memory?</p><h3 id=feeding-shadows>Feeding Shadows</h3><p>The city darkens earlier now, the rush of buses and taxi cabs replaced by the shush of delivery bikes. Lila, with her hours trimmed and savings dwindling, takes to volunteering at the community kitchen in the basement of a shuttered synagogue. Every Tuesday, she ladles soup and navigates tables set six feet apart. Most of the volunteers are regulars; most of the guests are not. A line snakes down the block, hungry bodies wrapped in thin coats, and Lila sees familiar eyes above unfamiliar masks.</p><p>Once, Lila meets Santino—a laid-off stagehand with a rumbling laugh and a fondness for quoting Shakespeare. They share quiet jokes and remnants of dinner rolls. “Last spring, I was working the lights at the Majestic,” he says, “and now I’m here, blinking in the dark.” When he mentions auditioning for odd jobs—anything about, “hanging lights, fixing things, fetching ghosts”—Lila offers him a wink and an extra scoop of beans.</p><p>After clean-up, Lila rides the subway home, watching masked faces reflected in the darkened windows. She listens to the silence between stops, heart aching for Santino, for herself, for all the people turned invisible by circumstance.</p><h3 id=the-forgotten-classroom>The Forgotten Classroom</h3><p>Lila’s best friend from college, Charlie, teaches kindergarten over video. Each day, he logs in to his laptop, cheerful in his cartoonish tie, coaxing laughter from a silent gallery of toddlers. “You learn to interpret the wiggling of icons,” he tells her after work. “A muted mic could be a tantrum or a dance break. I never know.”</p><p>Charlie confides his worries about the children he can’t reach: the screen frozen on a weary mother, the black square labeled “Device not found,” the little girl whose father coughs so much his voice disappears behind the closed captioning. Lila listens, letting the ache settle between them.</p><p>In June, he forwards her a picture sent by a parent: a kindergartner’s drawing of her teacher, rendered in crayon and labeled, “Mr. Charlie, I love you, don’t be sad.” The face is huge behind a blue mask, eyes wide above the shield.</p><p>“Sometimes,” Charlie whispers in a voiceless audio message, “the world shrinks so much, but hearts stay the same.”</p><h3 id=returning-to-the-dust>Returning to the Dust</h3><p>One evening, the store’s landlord calls. Business isn’t good. Rent remains relentless, eyes cold and businesslike on the other end of the line. “Two more months,” he says. “After that, we’ll need to revisit your lease.” The shelves aren’t empty, but the till is. Lila carefully boxes up the last delivery: a memoir, some poetry, three magazines no one ordered.</p><p>She sits on the counter in the dark, staring at the outlines of her life. She thinks about her first day here, the thrill of fitting books by subject, the slow but steady community that formed amid those stacks. She remembers Mr. Patel’s poems and Arturo’s music, Gwen’s shared recipes, Charlie’s stories of teaching behind a screen, Santino’s laugh in the soup line—so many lives, all moving in separate eddies but stuck in the same flood.</p><p>She hums an old song, the kind Arturo once played, the notes floating in the stillness. Outside, the city’s quiet feels different—a little less empty, a little more like potential.</p><h3 id=hope-arrives-in-paper-bags>Hope Arrives in Paper Bags</h3><p>In the weeks that follow, Lila organizes the last of the store’s surplus books for neighborhood giveaways. She leaves little bundles on stoops, ties poems to door handles, tucks thank-you notes for the postal workers and delivery drivers. Some days the phone rings, old customers checking in, voices brightening as they talk about stories they’ve read, meals they’ve concocted, family they’ve lost or found again. They thank Lila for the books, but she thanks them for their voices, for reminding her what connection can feel like.</p><p>Somehow, word spreads. She finds envelopes slipped under the door: spare change, IOUs, anonymous notes scribbled with gratitude and longing. “Keep going,” one reads. “We will see each other soon.”</p><h3 id=the-first-pages-of-tomorrow>The First Pages of Tomorrow</h3><p>Summer arrives ragged and humid. The city crackles with cicadas; masked faces cluster at markets and bus stops. Lila receives a letter from Gwen, a battered paperback of her favorite poems tucked inside and a photograph of Gwen and the rabbit, sun-drenched and laughing.</p><p>Mr. Patel now sits by his window again, the radio louder, sharing the bird poems he pens, while Charlie braves his first trip to the school playground, teaching kids to wave and smile with their eyes. Santino lands a job as a janitor at the reopened theater downtown, sweeping aisles and, sometimes, whistling arias to the empty balcony.</p><p>Lila’s shop does close, eventually, but she moves her books online—hosting story hours, virtual book clubs, care packages for lonely neighbors. People invite her into their homes through laptops and headphones, voices overlapping, laughter breaking through as they recall passages from battered novels, family recipes, tiny garden miracles that survived in window boxes.</p><p>Through it all, she holds onto the quiet truth the pandemic revealed: life’s meaning unfurls in the overlooked moments, in the invisible threads binding scattered hearts. There will always be forgotten stories, she thinks. But as long as someone remembers—even for a single afternoon—no one is truly lost.</p><p>The city stirs again, slowly, unevenly, the wounds of absence still fresh. Lila stands at her window as twilight settles, turning the painted stone Arturo once inspired in her hand, imagining new stories blooming in the spaces left behind by silence. She marks this page, promising not to forget.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/pandemic-stories/>Pandemic Stories</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-forgotten-ones-pandemic-survival-in-the-shadows/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Forgotten Ones: Pandemic Survival in the Shadows</span>
