It was September 1940, and the Battle of Britain was about to reach its peak.</p><p>In the small RAF fighter command base at RAF Kenley, a group of weary pilots gathered around their commander, Squadron Leader Maurice Thomas. They were aware of the mounting danger and knew that their next encounter with the Luftwaffe would be their most formidable yet. As Thomas addressed his pilots, his voice was steady, his gaze resolute.</p><p>&ldquo;Men, we face an incredible challenge. The destiny of Britain and perhaps the entire world hangs in the balance. But remember this: we are the few. We are the brave.&rdquo;</p><p>And so it was, that on this fateful day, a small band of incredibly courageous pilots would come to personify the spirit of the Battle of Britain.</p><hr><p>There was Flight Sergeant Johnnie Mitchell, a dashing 24-year-old with a twinkle in his eye and a cigarette perpetually pinned between his lips. He had already downed multiple enemy aircraft, earning him the nickname &ldquo;Micky&rdquo; after the popular RAF fighter, the Spitfire. But it was his unorthodox tactics that truly set him apart. As the German bombers approached, Mitchell devised a plan – he would skim low over the English Channel and surprise the lumbering bombers. With nimble acrobatics, Micky flung his Spitfire into a series of unpredictable (but always precise) maneuvers. While the Germans gaped, mesmerized by the dramatic aerial ballet, Micky slipped through their formations and picked off the unwary bombers.</p><hr><p>The day would also see the final acts of another pair of extraordinary pilots – Flight Lieutenant Geoffrey Page and Sergeant Archibald Wigglesworth. Theirs was a daring plan: a suicide mission, if you will. As the waves of Messerschmitts roared towards them, Page and Wigglesworth didn&rsquo;t break rank; instead, they attacked with reckless abandon. Whole formations of swarming enemies dismantled as the pair raced their Spitfires straight through the heart of the Luftwaffe. It seemed impossible, but Page and Wigglesworth seemed to be impervious to the German assaults. Theirs was a suicidal tactic, true, but as they both disappeared from the screen – having fired all their ammunition, it was calculated. It gave their comrades the chance to flee and regroup.</p><hr><p>As the German Air Force came to terms with the losses, another pilot fought his way into legend. Flight Lieutenant William Collins, flying a Spitfire painted in the colors of RAF Hornchurch, accumulated thirteen confirmed kills on that fateful day. His dogged tenacity became the stuff of legends. Collins would always fight, seemingly fearless – with his aircraft often within its last few rounds of ammunition – he rarely called for reinforcements, only searching out the enemy himself. Indeed, his aircraft would get peppered with bullet holes and pieces shot off, but he carried on, undeterred.</p><hr><p>As the clouds darkened and the battle raged, a young flight officer named Evelyn Ashford-Jones rested her eyes momentarily in her cockpit.</p><p>Evelyn had been an actress before the war, using her charm to grift her way into the legendary Air Transport Auxiliary. Now, as the Luftwaffe bore down on her, she momentarily closed her eyes to gather her resolve. She considered using her audience charm – giving voice to the radio, intimidating the Germans with her Grace. But she knew such a tactic would likely be her death.</p><p>With a deep breath, Evelyn returned to the fight. She flew her plane fearlessly, and her unique tactics confounded even the Luftwaffe&rsquo;s ace pilots. Her grace under pressure granted the British pilots just enough time and distance to flee, regroup, or strike back. Evelyn was soon dubbed &ldquo;The Darlin&rsquo; of the Defence.&rdquo;</p><hr><p>As fortune would have it, that day would mark a critical turning point in the Battle of Britain. The German High Command would no longer send forth their planes in grand, unopposed waves. The British fighter pilots – those brave few – had felled a terrifying percentage of their assailants. Evelyn, Micky, Geoffrey, Archibald, William – and so many more – who broadly fought in the Battle of Britain would feature in the folklore of the entire Allied Front.</p><p>It was this seemingly desperate, last-ditch defense of their island home that would eventually turn the tide of the Second World War. And in this folklore of the incredible courage displayed in the Battle of Britain, the name &lsquo;The Few&rsquo; would be invoked even by the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill himself.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/famous-battles/>Famous Battles</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-battle-of-yorktown-the-end-of-the-american-revolution/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Battle of Yorktown: The End of the American Revolution</span>
