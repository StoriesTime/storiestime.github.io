Detective John Fraserstein shivered and pulled his coat tighter around his burly frame as he trudged up the steps to the dilapidated brownstone. He could feel the chill seeping through the thin soles of his shoes, the worn tread no match for the unwelcoming bricks that led to the front door.</p><p>This, his latest case, had proven to be a nightmare of a puzzle. Before setting foot onto the decrepit stoop, he knew he was in for more than the usual quota of craziness. The Unsolved Riddle, no less.</p><p>Inside, he paused to light a cigarette, taking a long drag as he let his eyes adjust to the parlor of the house. The place was solemn, devoid of life except for the flickering shadows cast by the dancing flames of old portraits. The room seemed to mock him, eager to partake in its grim ruse and ride him to despair.</p><p>Detective Fraserstein exhaled a cloud of smoke that seemed to hang mournfully in the air, the weight of the case pressing heavily upon him. He turned to the sole occupant of the room - a spry, middle-aged man with a penchant for waxed moustaches and flashy suits who introduced himself as Quentin Humbolt, esteemed private investigator.</p><p>&ldquo;As usual, I&rsquo;m ahead of myself,&rdquo; Quentin offered confidently, adjusting his spectacles. &ldquo;What brings a sailor like you to my shores, Detective?&rdquo;</p><p>John glowered, stubbing his cigarette into a cracked dish by the door. &ldquo;Riddle me this, Mr. Humbolt,&rdquo; he began, his voice echoing off the walls. &ldquo;What happens when an unsolved case falls cold and the information is buried so deep that it returns like a specter from the past?&rdquo;</p><p>Quentin smirked, and in that moment, all semblance of congeniality vanished. &ldquo;Why it resurfaces in the form of a demanding case, of course!&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;The Unsolved Riddle is a beast of its own accord, Detective.&rdquo;</p><p>The two men exchanged a glare that spoke volumes. Rivals in more ways than one, it was their fate to circumvent one another in an aimless dance of determination and stubbornness.</p><p>John pressed on, the detestable weight in his stomach urging him forward as he recounted the dry, unsettling facts. No witness had come forward with any significant leads; the general populace had grown content to pigeonhole the unsolved case behind a veil of obscurity, vouchsafing their own lives in silence.</p><p>&ldquo;To the untrained eye, the Riddle might appear simplistic,&rdquo; Quentin said, toying with his waxed moustache. &ldquo;But as you prepare to take its soul, the overwhelming insight and intricacy of the puzzle will make you wish you&rsquo;d never stepped foot in this house.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not known to turn my back on a game,&rdquo; John quipped back, an edge of arrogance sneaking into his voice.</p><p>&ldquo;And yet you shall find that this riddle goes beyond the reach of your clever devices.&rdquo;</p><p>With an air of bravado, Fraserstein delved into the grimy case file twirling lazily in his hand. Every now and then, his keen eyes would lift, survey the dim corners of the room, as if hoping to unearth an explanation or a sliver of solace from the shadows.</p><p>The Unsolved Riddle had purportedly started in Deederville, where some of the most depraved and twisted minds had gathered en masse. It was the place that birthed the Riddle as whispers surged through the neighborhoods, streaking fear into the heart of innocent residents.</p><p>To this day, no one could agree on the origins of the riddle itself. Some claimed it was written in the skin of a slain snake, while others said that it had arrived via smoke from the chimneys of Deederville&rsquo;s tenements, taunting, teasing, until citizens dared to piece the words together.</p><p>When the riddle was divulged, an inexplicable panic seized the streets, peopleâ€™s faces strewn with a mixture of dread and confusion. The words crept aloud in everyone&rsquo;s minds, a haunting and unnerving declaration:</p><p>&ldquo;In the bowels of Deederville, seek thee the heart,
The home of death, the wicked art.
Find the key to the vault of lies,
For therein rests the soul of the prize.&rdquo;</p><p>The riddle concluded with a fractional rhyme, &ldquo;unsound, unturned, the truth shall burn.&rdquo;</p><p>Within a fortnight, six of the wealthiest families in the city vanished into the gaunt void of the night. Only their possessions remained; a monetarily rich yet soulless toll paid to the churning wheels of Deederville.</p><p>&ldquo;We found their corpses a fortnight later. Executed with splendid barbarity.&rdquo; John recounted, the mangled bodies scorched upon his retina. He suspected what transpired through the gaping eyelids of the lifeless, their terror perhaps still lingering in the macabre manner of their demise.</p><p>Quentin hummed in sympathy. &ldquo;The key to the vault of lies&mldr;what manner of deceit lies within?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hence our futile research into the Deederville&rsquo;s most obscure enclaves.&rdquo;</p><p>As the night wore on and whispers of Deederville devolved into a series of somber broodings, Detective Fraserstein and Mr. Humbolt found themselves trading leads without thought of competition. The puzzle was far too large, and its inscrutable grasp was opposed by no lesser force than the allure of truth.</p><p>Thus, as the first haze of dawn climbed into the quiet skies above, the city&rsquo;s greatest sleuths juxtaposed the cryptic scripture against their mental stages of reasoning and consequence.</p><p>John turned the matter over in his mind, the rich tapestry of mystery and enigma invitingly luring even the coldest of nerves. A thought took shape as he moved gingerly about the dank house.</p><p>&ldquo;When last waltzed the shadows, did they whisper the same riddles as those of old folklore?&rdquo;</p><p>Quentin&rsquo;s grip around his moustache stiffened. &ldquo;Perhaps, Fraserstein, that&rsquo;s the very crux of the enigma we seek.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And when the riddle is vanquished,&rdquo; John continued, &ldquo;Deederville may still be in danger.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The soul of the prize must be unveiled,&rdquo; Quentin finished, nodding.</p><p>It had been handed down in urban legend, through voices that hauntingly threaded the veins of whispered secrets and slain whispers. A spectral spirit romped through the labyrinthine underground passages, a phantom thief who traversed the murky alleyways of Deederville.</p><p>The Unsolved Riddle grew evermore clamorous as the fruitless pursuit of the truth seemed as evermore momentous. Time and time again, Fraserstein revealed his knack for unwrapping bewildering details at the snap of his fingers.</p><p>And now, he knew the key to the vault of lies; it was nothing more than the ancient relic of Deederville&rsquo;s foregone unhinged history. A harrowing method to entrap and manipulate Deederville&rsquo;s few remaining nemesis, indeed the key to the vault of lies: the spirit of deceit itself.</p><p>In the coldest, most reverberant hours of the night, as the sibling species of light and darkness wrestled, it was decided. Fraserstein and Humbolt would face the garbled remnant of fear and dread side by side in Deederville, crafted to test the mettle of strong men and women alike.</p><p>&ldquo;Was there ever love in the shadow of objects?&rdquo; John Fraserstein whispered, the abyssal chasms within him deepening.</p><p>From the countless stories floating alight in Deederville, the curse of the unsolved riddle offered slender hope to the weary traveler.</p><p>With unblemished resolve, the shadows yielded, and the truth took form.</p><p>As the hunter became the hunted in the wretched hum of Deederville, Fraserstein held steadfast, the knowledge he sought metamorphosing each step into a salve for the aching wound that was the Unsolved Riddle.</p><p>With each successive day, the Unsolved Riddle was deconstructed, and the bold mask of truth dawning upon Deederville erased the shadows that once twisted the hearts of many. The fools of the Riddle slunk away, heeding the wails of their forsaken souls and now, the unswerving clarity of Fraserstein and Humbolt&rsquo;s venture conjoined.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/crime-and-detective-stories/>Crime and Detective Stories</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-unsolved-case-of-the-missing-heiress/><span class=title>Â« Prev</span><br><span>The Unsolved Case of the Missing Heiress</span>
