The air was crisp and carried the faint scent of fallen leaves and chimney smoke, while the streets bustled with people wearing scarves and sipping warm beverages. I was cozy in my small apartment, wrapped in a blanket that had seen better days, scrolling through a recipe website that had popped up on my social media feed. The pictures promised dishes that looked tantalizingly succulent: golden-brown roasted chicken, velvety soups, and desserts glistening with sugary perfection. It stirred something in me—curiosity. Could I create something like this? Could I cook?</p><p>Despite decades of failed attempts and ordering takeout more often than I cared to admit, I felt a spark of ambition. My culinary résumé was bleak and dotted with disasters: soupy mashed potatoes at a family holiday dinner, cookies so dense they could have doubled as paperweights, and an ill-advised attempt to poach eggs which ended in some sort of egg cloud catastrophe. Yet, the lure of creating something wholesome with my own two hands was irresistible. I decided to start small. An easy stir-fry recipe promised minimal steps, basic ingredients, and success virtually guaranteed.</p><p>I jotted down the list: chicken breasts, broccoli, peppers, soy sauce, garlic, and ginger. A small voice in my head muttered skepticism, but I ignored it. The next morning, I ventured into the supermarket, determined. I felt a fleeting sense of competence as I scanned aisle after aisle, locating fresh ginger among intimidating shelves of spices I’d barely heard of, lifting bright green broccoli crowns into a bag, and picking out slender, glossy peppers. Visualizing the vibrant, appetizing stir-fry, I filled my shopping cart with optimism.</p><p>Back at my apartment, the battle began. I approached it like a general ready for war—as if cooking was something to be conquered. I lined up my ingredients on the counter, grabbed a half-unwrapped cutting board from under the sink, and reached for the knife. Everything was ready to go, or so I thought.</p><p>As a novice in knife technique, I decided that speed would make up for an absolute lack of skill. After all, how hard could it be to dice chicken breasts and chop broccoli? Soon after chipping away at the chicken with wild, irregular strokes, a butcher would have sworn I was using a garden shovel. The pieces were uneven at best, misshapen lumps at worst. Somehow, one shard of bone lodged itself in my recipe &ldquo;prep station,&rdquo; adding instant drama. The broccoli fared no better beneath my blade as I obliterated it into a mix of chunks and powdery flakes resembling green confetti. By the time I reached the peppers, my wrist was sore, and frankly, I questioned this entire endeavor.</p><p>Nonetheless, recipe steps are sacred, and I soldiered onward. Step two involved heating oil—a phrase so deceptively simple, it cloaked imminent disaster. My frying pan waited patiently on the stovetop as I poured in oil—perhaps more than necessary. When I turned the burner on, I decided to multitask, not fully realizing the error of my ways.</p><p>Perhaps the garlic was to blame. Its conviction to ruin me was sealed when I struggled to smash, peel, and mince it. Pieces slipped from my grip like soap, and overwhelming waves of garlic smell invaded the kitchen as I smashed harder, creating a mess worthy of documentary footage on novice chefs. By the time I finished, I turned back to find my pan shimmering—oil bubbling like lava, smoke whispering ominously toward the ceiling.</p><p>Panic finally kicked in. Was I supposed to let oil get this hot? Was I cooking, or had I accidentally summoned some ancient god of fire? Without thinking, I tossed the chicken into the bubbling mess. The result—a volcanic hiss followed by oil splatter taking siege of both my stovetop and my dignity. I leaped back in horror only to collide with the counter and knock over the soy sauce bottle I had precariously balanced. My socks squelched as I stood in newly sticky puddles of soy-sauce chaos, one hand holding a spatula and the other gripping a dishrag like I was preparing for battle.</p><p>And yet, blindly I pressed forward into what could only be described as culinary purgatory. Adding the remaining ingredients to the pan was meant to be the triumphant climax, the stage where everything came together. Broccoli and peppers were supposed to join the mix, blending seamlessly with ginger and garlic for that aromatic stir-fry harmony. What actually happened was far removed from my dreams: vegetables went limp beneath miscalculated heat, sauces drowned every semblance of freshness, and the chicken clung stubbornly to the pan, resistive to all interventions.</p><p>The smoke alarm began screeching, loyal to its job but ruthless in timing. Windows flew open amid the screaming alarm, and I waved a frantically torn magazine in an attempt to banish the evidence of combustion enveloping my apartment air. Still, I refused to give up entirely, scooping gooey masses of stir-fry tragedy onto a plate. Near-blackened fragments dotted the dish like islands of despair surrounded by soupy, soy-colored clutter.</p><p>The first bite was a revelation—of failure. Somehow, through sheer magic or mistake, the chicken was both rubbery and burned. The vegetables tasted defeated, devoid of texture or semblance of health. But the sauce—that cursed mountain of soy-eyed regret—was the star of the disaster, taking over every crevice of my poorly assembled meal with overwhelming saltiness that made my face pucker for hours.</p><p>What I learned didn’t fully hit me until the next morning—the lingering smell of burned oil clung stubbornly to every crevice of my apartment. My clothes smelled of stir-fry failure, and even my hair seemed faintly seasoned with regret. I looked at the mess still covering my counters, and it dawned on me: cooking wasn’t just “preparing food,” but an act that required patience, technique, and a respect for the delicate balance of heat and measurement. Something I clearly lacked.</p><p>Despite my earnest effort, I had unraveled the sacred art of cooking into a chaotic accident—a mess of emotions, destruction, and misplaced ambition. That one evening confirmed what I always suspected but had tried to deny: I should never try cooking. Some people are meant to create culinary masterpieces. Others, like me, are meant to appreciate them from a safe distance—preferably delivered by professionals in neatly packed boxes.</p><p>And so, my journey in cooking came to a sharp and smoky halt. My refrigerator may still host ingredients, but my heart belongs to takeout menus forevermore.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/comedy-and-humor/>Comedy and Humor</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/why-i-should-never-be-left-in-charge-of-anything/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Why I Should Never Be Left in Charge of Anything</span>
