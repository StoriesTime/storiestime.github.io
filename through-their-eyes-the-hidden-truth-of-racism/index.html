The streets of Cinder Hollow stretched in muted gray, slick from the remnants of a night rain. Windows pulsed with the sleepy gold of rising kettles and frying eggs. On Maple Avenue, the clatter of garbage trucks bantered with the coo of doves. All seemed as it was, as most mornings began.</p><p>But the air caught Lina’s breath as she stepped outside. She could always tell when the eyes shifted—when inquisitiveness darkened into that wandering, hovering study that made her skin nearly itch. Lina Hoang had grown used to it: the double take, the kernel of doubt in a stranger’s smile, the tugging curiosity her family’s faces provoked. There was a rhythm to it, as regular as any heartbeat, singing quietly in the background every day of her life.</p><p>She ducked her head, zipped her yellow raincoat, and hurried down the steps. She moved through the street like a fluent note, passing the cracked mural by the bus stop—a faded swirl of children holding hands, skin colored in every shade the artist could muster. The irony only made her want to laugh.</p><p>At her side, her phone buzzed with a text:<br><strong>Dai: See u at the bakery. Bring your smile.</strong></p><p>She let the ghost of a smile flit across her lips. Dai’s bakery, “Rise and Shine,” was the sum of several generations’ recipes and trials. Her mother’s knees were now dusted with flour more than any other kind of powder. The aroma of cardamom and baked sesame lingered eternally in her hair.</p><p>But business hadn’t been the same lately. It started small: a murmur that their mooncakes were “too sweet,” a review online complaining the owner “spoke poor English.” Then, last spring, the window was broken. Nothing was stolen, just glass cast in starlit shards. Lina had swept them up with numb hands.</p><p>She walked faster.</p><h3 id=by-noon>By Noon</h3><p>Inside the bakery, warm light inhabited every nook. Dai, her brother, stood at the counter sculpting dough into moon-faced buns. Their mother busied herself filling trays with pork floss rolls, humming an old lullaby. The only customer, Mrs. Simmons, greeted Lina with a hesitant wave, clutching a brown paper bag like a life jacket.</p><p>Lina put on her practiced smile. “Morning, Mrs. Simmons. Would you like any oolong today?”</p><p>The old woman’s eyes darted, tight around the corners. “Just the milk bread, dear.” She paused, lowering her voice. “It’s so much…safer here than it used to be, don’t you think?”</p><p>Lina’s first instinct was to nod, to appease. Safer for whom, she wanted to ask. But silence felt like armor, and she wore it well.</p><p>As Mrs. Simmons left, Dai looked up. “She forgot her tea.”<br>Lina shrugged. “She’ll be back.”</p><p>Dai dusted flour from his hands. “You see the local news? Another story about that new guy running for council. He’s talking about, you know, ‘community values.’ Code for—”<br>She rolled her eyes. “Code for not us? I’m familiar.”<br>Dai’s jaw ticked, like it always did when he was worrying without words. “We could put out more American stuff. Apple turnovers. Cupcakes with flags.”<br>Lina scoffed. “Or we could just be us.”</p><p>Their mother shot them a steely look. “Arguing won’t fill the bakery.”</p><p>So they worked, the three of them a silent orchestra, hearts tuned tightly to each other yet scattered—one eye always on the door, braced for the next slight, the next odd look.</p><h3 id=a-new-face>A New Face</h3><p>At 2 P.M., just as their nerves had settled into the lull of afternoon, the bell above the door trilled. In stepped a man Lina hadn’t seen before—square-shouldered, with a brown leather satchel and glasses that glinted with intelligence. His gaze slid over the display case, then settled on her with a smile that actually reached his eyes.</p><p>“Hi there. Any chance you’ve got bánh mì today?”<br>Lina blinked—most locals asked for simple pastries, but… “We make them fresh. Pork or vegan?”<br>“Pork, please. And do you guys do egg tarts?”<br>“Only if you’re lucky,” she said, a little daringly.<br>He grinned. “Egg tart it is.”</p><p>As she filled his order, he glanced at the photos behind the register: her family, their first day in Cinder Hollow, her father smiling in a sea of relatives Lina hardly remembered.</p><p>“Your family’s from Hanoi?” he asked with practiced gentleness.<br>She nodded. “You know it?”<br>“Visited once,” he replied. “Walked all over the old quarter. Got lost, had the best bowl of phở of my life.”</p><p>She smiled for real, warmth prickling in her chest.</p><p>Dai sidled up, handing over the fresh bánh mì. “Lot of folks don’t come here for the Vietnamese stuff. Too adventurous for them.”<br>The man raised an eyebrow. “Their loss.” He scribbled on a napkin, pushed it across the counter. “I’m Julian. I teach at the college. I bring students here all the time. Hope you don’t mind.”<br>“Bring as many as you like,” Lina replied, voice almost hopeful.</p><p>He left with a twinkle in his eye, greeting their mother with a respectful chào as he passed. When the bell jingled again, the bakery seemed, for an instant, to breathe easier.</p><h3 id=the-quiet-wounds>The Quiet Wounds</h3><p>That sense of ease, though, faded as quickly as the sunlight outside. By late afternoon, the whispers had returned—a woman tapping on her phone, snapping a photo out the window; a pair of teens snickering and mimicking chopstick movements. Lina fought not to flinch.</p><p>After closing, their mother sat heavily by the window, folding one last napkin.<br>“You know,” she said quietly, “when I was a girl, people spit by our door every day in Saigon. I thought, new country, new faces—better dreams.”<br>Lina rested her head on her mother’s shoulder. “Some people love us. Julian’s nice.”<br>Her mother sighed. “It’s enough. Sometimes. Sometimes not.”</p><h3 id=across-town>Across Town</h3><p>Elsewhere, across Cinder Hollow, Rashid Olamide mopped up spilled juice in the back aisle of GreenMart. Summer always brought the kids, always brought the messes, but also the sideways glances. The worst was the manager—a red-haired man with too-small shoes who never, ever forgot to check Rashid’s pockets when his shift ended.</p><p>Today was pay day. Rashid scanned his slip: hours not quite right, wages tweaked down to the nearest cent. He didn’t bother arguing. The last time he did, he’d been called “uppity.” The humiliation still burned beneath his skin.</p><p>On the walk home, Rashid paused by the community board. Someone had tacked up flyers for a missing dog, a yoga class, and, sandwiched in between, a new group:<br><strong>“Cinder Hollow Unity. Come Share Your Stories.”</strong></p><p>He tore off the little slip with the time and place. He wasn’t sure he’d go. He wasn’t sure anyone would listen.</p><h3 id=gathering-storm>Gathering Storm</h3><p>That evening, Lina set the bakery’s money box beside Dai and counted quietly. “Three regulars, two strangers, six cupcakes left.”<br>Dai rubbed his eyes. “We can’t keep going like this.”<br>Their mother placed her hand over theirs. “We have to.”</p><p>The neon sign flickered outside, painting the dusk a watery blue. Lina watched shoppers hurry past, some glancing at the bakery with curiosity, others averting their eyes like the building itself was a painful secret.</p><p>She thought about Rashid, whom she’d met briefly at the town library, shyly helping with a book club for kids. She wondered if he felt the same quiet exhaustion, the way the world sometimes seemed to grade you on a scale you couldn’t even see.</p><p>She texted him, almost on impulse.<br><strong>Lina: there’s a unity meeting tomorrow. you going?</strong><br>Within moments:<br><strong>Rashid: maybe. not sure anyone cares what i have to say</strong><br>She replied:<br><strong>Lina: i do</strong></p><h3 id=words-and-silence>Words and Silence</h3><p>The next evening, the little church basement was already buzzing. Rigged with folding chairs and stale coffee, the air crackled with a nervous, uneven energy. Lina and Rashid found themselves seated together in the third row. People filtered in: a Somali mother with careful braids; a Latino cook from the taco truck on Main; an elderly Black couple from the old neighborhood; three white college students clutching notebooks.</p><p>The organizer, a young woman named Naomi, stepped to the front. “We’re here to listen. To speak. Say as much or as little as you want.”</p><p>At first, no one spoke. The silence was thick, stitched with centuries of unspoken burdens. Finally, the Somali woman, Miriam, lifted her hand.</p><p>She spoke, soft but fierce, about her son coming home bruised after school, about being told to “speak English” in the checkout line. Each phrase landed like a bead in a rosary—painful, beautiful, relentless.</p><p>Rashid spoke next—slowly, reluctantly. He spoke of double standards at work, of being made to feel like a walking question mark. Lina listened, chest tight. She shared too: the broken window, the online taunts, her longing for normalcy that never materialized no matter how hard she smiled.</p><p>One by one, voices joined. The floor felt sacred—seared open and alive with stories too long muffled. Even the college students glowed with uncomfortable understanding.</p><p>“We can’t fix what we won’t face,” Naomi said gently, at the end. “But we see each other, tonight.”</p><h3 id=tides-shift>Tides Shift</h3><p>Afterward, the group lingered outside. The streetlamps pressed soft halos into the dusk. Rashid turned to Lina, searching her face for some word that wouldn’t sound hollow.</p><p>“Thanks for convincing me to come.”</p><p>She nudged him. “Thanks for trusting me.”</p><p>A new voice broke in—Julian, the teacher from the bakery. “These things matter,” he said. “You matter. The stories change everything, even if it’s slow.”</p><p>Lina considered that. She’d grown up with her ears full of stories, her family’s migration sewn into her marrow. She’d thought maybe sharing them wouldn’t do much, but tonight she felt, for the first time, something lift—a loosening, a fullness.</p><h3 id=a-turning>A Turning</h3><p>In the weeks that followed, threads of connection stitched through Cinder Hollow. Julian brought colleagues and students to the bakery; Rashid stood a little taller at GreenMart, sometimes nodding to strangers in aisles as if daring them to really see him. The unity group became a chorus, small but steady, and even the mural at the bus stop seemed brighter.</p><p>Change moved slowly. Mrs. Simmons gradually stopped flinching at Lina’s accent, and once complimented her on the mooncakes. Teens laughed less often at Dai’s careful English. A second bakery window stayed unbroken for the rest of the year.</p><p>But not every wound healed. Rashid’s manager found new ways to grind him down. Sometimes, Lina found new bite marks in her online reviews, new slights she had no words for.</p><p>Yet, they persisted. They grew. Their laughter in the group meetings sounded a little less brittle. They spoke up for each other, in line, in city hall, at the bus stop. Their presence, once regarded as oddity, became a kind of brittle music, then—slowly—a harmony.</p><h3 id=through-their-eyes>Through Their Eyes</h3><p>In the dark, Lina sometimes lay awake, remembering both the slights and the kindnesses. She wondered if, in another world, her story would not be marked by quiet defenses and sharpened smiles. She wondered if, one day, kids would pass her bakery and see just a bakery, not a border. Just a neighbor, not a stranger.</p><p>She got up and wrote this thought in her journal:</p><blockquote><p>“Our eyes are open. The truth is in our stories, how we tend them, how we make room for each other to tell them. I see you. Maybe you’ll see me, too.”</p></blockquote><p>Morning returned. Cinder Hollow yawned awake, as always, but there was a difference now—a burst of laughter under the bakery awning, the bounce of sunlight across fresh-swept sidewalks.</p><p>Racism did not vanish. It never had, and the deep roots remained tangled beneath the soil. But through the eyes of Lina, Rashid, and every voice brave enough to confess the burdens they bore, the truth came into the light. Little by little, in stories and in silences broken, the world shifted its gaze—and, for a breath, held it long enough to see.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/racism-and-prejudice/>Racism and Prejudice</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/through-their-eyes-powerful-racism-stories/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Through Their Eyes: Powerful Racism Stories</span>
