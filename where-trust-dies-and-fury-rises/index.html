The sound was a steady tattoo, masking the tension in the room as much as it masked the world beyond. Quincy stared at the rusted revolver lying on the worn oak table, its clean barrel a sharp contrast to the grime and decay encasing everything else. His fingers hovered just above it, trembling.</p><p>Across from him, Marianne leaned against the faded wallpaper. Her dark eyes watched him with an unsettling calm, arms folded as though the chill of the room didn&rsquo;t claw at her bones. The space between them was suffocating, though neither of them moved to close it.</p><p>&ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t have to come to this,&rdquo; her voice cut through the silence like a blade.</p><p>Quincy flinched at her words, though he still hadn&rsquo;t met her gaze. His focus remained on the revolver. He had spent years trusting her—years believing they were part of something bigger, something pure. But purity was fragile, he had learned, and trust was all but ephemeral.</p><p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t it, though?&rdquo; he said finally, his voice hoarse in the dim haze. &ldquo;Did you ever actually believe we&rsquo;d make it out alive? That we could keep something like this under wraps forever?&rdquo;</p><p>Her expression didn&rsquo;t change. &ldquo;I believed in you.&rdquo;</p><p>The words lingered in the thick air, pressing down against his chest as guilt mingled with the simmering pools of rage lurking within him. He felt the weight of her accusation, heavier than the revolver he now picked up. It gleamed under the low-hanging bulb, promising death just as surely as it promised release.</p><p>&ldquo;It seems to me, Marianne, you believe in convenience more than trust.&rdquo; He narrowed his eyes now, raising his gaze to her finally. &ldquo;Otherwise, you&rsquo;d have told me about the money.&rdquo;</p><p>At last, her composure shifted. A blink, subtle, but it was all Quincy needed.</p><p>Her silence felt louder than any confession could&rsquo;ve been.</p><p>The money hadn&rsquo;t been much—not at first, anyway. A missing deposit here, a slightly-different ledger number there. The kind of small details Quincy could excuse. But over time, the trickle grew to a flood, and the discrepancies too glaring to ignore. It wasn&rsquo;t a single bank, or the grocery scheme they&rsquo;d orchestrated with careful precision over years. It was everywhere—bits of distrust woven into the fragile web of their partnership. Each fiber frayed without his knowing.</p><p>&ldquo;I was securing something for us,&rdquo; she said at last. Her voice didn&rsquo;t waver, though the edge of defensiveness sharpened every syllable. &ldquo;In case things fell apart. Like they are now, apparently.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Funny how your idea of preparation involves keeping me in the dark, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she demanded suddenly, shoving off the wall and stepping closer. &ldquo;Why is this an issue now? Why pull out the theatrics? You always knew this wouldn&rsquo;t last. You always knew we&rsquo;d have to adapt to survive.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I knew we needed trust to survive!&rdquo; His voice thundered through the small room, eclipsing the storm&rsquo;s pounding rhythm outside. Quincy slammed the gun back on the table with enough force that the legs groaned under the impact. &ldquo;I knew that survival meant sacrifice—not betrayal.&rdquo;</p><p>Her face twisted. &ldquo;And what exactly have you sacrificed, Quincy? Huh? Name one thing. Because the way I see it, I&rsquo;ve been the one cleaning up all your messes for years!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I never <em>sold</em> us out.&rdquo;</p><p>At this, her lips parted slightly—but no rebuttal came. The accusation landed hard, striking them both in places they hadn&rsquo;t dared acknowledge yet. Quincy could see the flicker of fury rise behind her carefully neutral expression, but he didn&rsquo;t flinch. Anger, these days, felt like his only true companion.</p><p>&ldquo;And what about you, huh?&rdquo; She hissed the words now, venom dripping with every syllable. &ldquo;You really think you&rsquo;re so righteous. You think this isn&rsquo;t just as much your fault as it is mine?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I never lied to you!&rdquo; He was on his feet now, the chair scraping loudly against the rickety floorboards. &ldquo;I never hid anything from you or pocketed a dime for myself. I trusted you. But clearly, that was my mistake.&rdquo;</p><p>For a moment, they stood frozen, neither willing to flinch, neither ready to admit the depth of their anger or the weight of what they&rsquo;d lost. The partnership had been fragile for a while, though neither of them had wanted to say it aloud. Fueled by ambition and necessity, they had ignored the crumbling foundations beneath them.</p><p>And now, standing in the aftermath, all they had was fury. Fury&mldr; and the gun.</p><p>&ldquo;You want revenge, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Marianne finally said, her voice far softer than Quincy expected. Her hands rose slightly, palms out—a gesture both of surrender and taunt all at once. &ldquo;You want to blame me for everything. You think putting that revolver between us is going to make you feel less guilty for how everything turned out?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not revenge,&rdquo; Quincy replied, stepping closer. His grip tightened. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s justice.&rdquo;</p><p>She scoffed. The sound was bitter and ugly; a mirror of who she&rsquo;d become. &ldquo;Justice? You&rsquo;re delusional. You think pulling that trigger is going to fix anything about this mess we&rsquo;ve created?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;ll make me feel better about the fact that I trusted the wrong person.&rdquo;</p><p>The rain outside intensified, the storm&rsquo;s fury aligning perfectly with the chaos within. They didn’t speak again, but the silence spoke volumes. Trust hadn’t just died here tonight—it had been murdered, slowly and painfully, over months of lies, stolen opportunities, and quiet betrayals.</p><p>As the gun trembled in Quincy’s hand, its weight shifted—perhaps metaphorically more than physically. He hadn&rsquo;t yet decided how the story between them would end. But one thing was certain: if trust was dead, fury could only grow to consume everything that once was.</p><p>And in the end, perhaps it couldn&rsquo;t be stopped.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/betrayal-and-revenge/>Betrayal and Revenge</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/when-the-betrayed-turns-the-blade/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>When the Betrayed Turns the Blade</span>
