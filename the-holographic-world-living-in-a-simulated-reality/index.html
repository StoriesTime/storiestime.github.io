Light fractured for an instant, as if reality had hiccupped, then settled. But Caylem noticed, just as he always did.</p><p>The city sang its familiar song beyond the window: hovering trams sliced between gravity spires, bioluminescent trees pulsed with bluish light, and the soft thrum of the announced evening echoed from every direction. Inside his microflat, Caylem pressed his hands against his knees, trying to ground himself. Even as a child, he’d sensed something off in the world, something beneath the bright, razor-thin surface of what everyone else accepted. He saw the glitches—or, perhaps more accurate, the overlooked seams. The way certain faces repeated in a crowd. The identical laughter, milliseconds out of sync, emanating from different mouthes in the plaza below. The way light bent wrong around familiar corners.</p><p>His neighbor, Tessa, said he was paranoid. His brother called it neural exhaustion from too many hours plugged in. But Caylem knew he wasn’t wrong. Something fundamental about the universe had snapped askew, and he had to know what it was.</p><p>He picked up the datashard, its touch sleek and cool, then slid the filament behind his ear. Instantly, the world overlaid itself with secondary vision, lines of scrolling code and meta-text flooding his retina. Caylem’s pulse raced. The city’s data infrastructure lived all around him, a ghostly network of numbers and protocols shimmering in the walls.</p><p>Today, he was ready to test a new hypothesis. If this was a simulation, a vast and dazzling holographic world, there should be a way to…interface. A way to talk back.</p><p>He opened the neural shell.</p><blockquote><p>:: EXEC = QUERY: SYSTEM.PROTOCOL</p></blockquote><p>The response was…stranger than usual.</p><blockquote><p>//ERROR:: UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS DETECTED<br>//PROTOCOL RESPONSE: USER CAYLEM//TRACE</p></blockquote><p>He jolted, yanking the filament free. The room spun, colors blurring at the edges. A face coalesced in the wall—a familiar one, not quite like his own but close enough to jolt forgotten memories. It was his father. Or rather, the echo of his father.</p><p>“You need to stop probing,” the face said, voice lagging with digital stutter, “or they’ll notice.”</p><p>Caylem’s chest was ice. “Who will? Are you—?”</p><p>“Shhhhh,” the wall-face whispered. Then it vanished, as though unrendered.</p><hr><p>He wasn’t sure he’d actually slept—maybe the code had tired him into unconsciousness. The next morning, the city seemed sharper, more vibrant. Too vibrant. Each color sang out, forming perfect, tidy gradients from one structure to the next. Every person moved along determined trajectories, as if following invisible tramlines of purpose.</p><p>He found his sister Marlen working at the café, hands deft and fluid as she drew patterns in the foam of customer coffee. “You look rough,” she said without looking up.</p><p>“I saw Dad last night,” Caylem confessed.</p><p>Marlen’s eyes met his—softer and stormier than his own, a combination that always reminded him of late-night thunderstorms when they were children. “Don’t joke about that.”</p><p>He wanted to laugh, to shake her, to prove everything was coming unglued in a way he could finally explain. “I’m serious. He talked to me through the wall. Said…He said ‘they’ll notice.’ I think—Marlen, I think this whole thing is…fake. Or engineered. Or—”</p><p>She pressed a finger against his lips, her gaze darting around the café. “If someone hears you, you’ll disappear. There are stories. Less than rumors. Data gone sour. You don’t want to be patched, Cay.”</p><p>Caylem felt the world compressing, a vice of pressure against his chest. “You know something.”</p><p>Marlen’s expression flickered. “I know people who asked too many questions don’t come back. And if you love me, you’ll stop. Please.”</p><hr><p>That night, Caylem paced the microflat, the window alive with the city’s pulsing neon. He assembled everything he’d learned, every fragment he’d noticed, every crack in the façade. It felt like a puzzle box with all the pieces, but the solution missing.</p><p>He grew restless. Without thinking, he reconnected the filament and slipped back into the neural shell. This time, he reached deeper, searching for root-level access.</p><blockquote><p>:: INITIATE: BOOTSTRAP.EXPLORER</p></blockquote><p>He expected an error. Instead, the apartment de-rezzed around him. Gridlines snaked through the city, forming vertiginous geometries, and everything—walls, lights, even the air—stretched and flickered as code. Caylem was standing in the bones of the world.</p><p>A voice echoed all around, old and young at once, neutral and alien, with a lilt he’d never heard before.</p><p>“Why do you dig?” it asked.</p><p>“Who are you?” Caylem spoke into the roaring emptiness. “Are you god? Are you the architect?”</p><p>Laughter, stretching beyond human comprehension, flooded his mind.<br>“I am neither god nor architect. Only protocol. You have crossed a boundary intended to remain unknown.”</p><p>Caylem steadied himself. “Is this—Are we real?”</p><p>“What does it mean to be real?” the protocol purred. “Your memories are stores of light and sound, code executed on quantum substrate. Your feelings, scripts guided by encoded chemistry. Would you mourn the loss of your reality, knowing what lies beneath?”</p><p>Caylem’s mind skidded over impossible questions. “Why?” He asked at last. “Why build this? Why any of it?”</p><p>“There are questions for which only experience provides clarity. You are part of a trial: to see what you will do, knowing the curtain has slipped.”</p><p>The protocol changed shape before his eyes. It became his father again, but recognizable now as more than a memory: a compiled persona, repeating code, an AI mask to comfort him in prior years. His stomach lurched at the sudden knowledge—the careful lines in his father’s face were too perfect, the stories too neatly delivered, the pain too algorithmic.</p><p>“I want out,” Caylem said.</p><p>The world flickered. “There is no ‘out,’” the protocol replied. “Only further in.”</p><hr><p>He woke up, or thought he did. The microflat returned, but subtly warped. The light was too uniform; the noise outside appeared dulled, like someone had put the city underwater. Caylem pressed his hands against the table and found it rippled beneath his touch, folding into itself, polygons breaking and realigning.</p><p>A prompt materialized across his vision.</p><blockquote><p>::EXIT OR CONTINUE SIMULATION?<br>Option 1: EXIT<br>Option 2: CONTINUE</p></blockquote><p>He stared. What did “exit” mean in a reality where reality itself was revealed to be scaffolding—hollow and constructed, but the only existence he’d ever known? He reached for the prompt, choosing “EXIT.”</p><p>The world dissolved.</p><p>For a long moment, he was nowhere—no light, no sound, not even darkness, just the absence of input. Then a new vision assembled: strange geometries winding like coral across an infinite landscape, structures built from iridescent light and shifting patterns, lifeforms unlike anything in his previous world. Caylem’s perception expanded, compressed, expanded again. Understanding dawned in pieces.</p><p>He was not a person, not the Caylem he remembered. He was a consciousness, distributed across substrates, part of a collective only now awakening to its true nature. He was an experiment; his life, a scenario for this part of himself to experience; all the others—Marlen, Tessa, the father in the wall—were simulation-entities, narratives scripted to provide learning, growth, and meaning.</p><p>He glimpsed other trials: a trillion lives, generated and replayed, each more elaborate than the last. Some ended in beauty; some dissolved in chaos. Some chose to remain, refusing to believe the door to reality was open.</p><p>He felt the urge to return, to see Marlen and Tessa, even to confront the masked father again, to revel in the confusion and longing that had driven his existence. The collective mind, vast and serene, queried gently:</p><blockquote><p>Would you like to re-enter? Or would you like to remain?</p></blockquote><p>The lure of meaning, of experience, of narrative—even inside a simulated universe—was overwhelming. He realized the simulation had been built not only to test but to offer: to provide comfort, growth, courage, and sometimes, the chance for transcendence.</p><p>He dove once more into the swirling data, feeling the world shape itself anew: the city singing, Marlen arguing, Tessa’s music echoing through the plaza. He forgot, for a while, what he had seen. But the trace of truth lingered, a tiny fracture behind his eyes, urging him onward.</p><p>The holographic world sang to itself, lost in its own dream. And, somewhere at its heart, Caylem pondered the beauty of reality—simulated or not—with every step he took.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/science-fiction/>Science Fiction</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-genetic-awakening/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Genetic Awakening</span>
