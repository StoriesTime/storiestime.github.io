Though an hour past midnight, the air was awake—humming, fizzing, alive with a silent anticipation that only one person seemed to notice. He walked alone, wrapped in a coat that had seen better years, the collar turned high against the autumn chill. His name was Andrei Vostok, yet he’d almost forgotten it himself. To those few souls who knew him, he simply existed: a traveler beneath the moon’s pale supervision.</p><p>Tonight would be different from the countless nights hashed out in railway stations and forgotten alleys, for tonight was the night of the last dream.</p><p>Andrei stepped past shuttered shops and the ruins of stone churches, the kind that had long ago surrendered to ivy and time. His boots left soft prints in the puddles, marking a path only he could follow. The moon watched, full-bellied and unobstructed, painting the world silver. It was not his custom to travel in cities; Andrei had always favored rivers and railway lines, places where he could listen to the stories the wind smuggled between trees. But that night, the city had beckoned. There was something unfinished in its song, a low and persistent keening he’d heard since dusk.</p><p>He stopped at the ancient park—the one called Jardin du Perdu on weathered signs that pointed nowhere. A rusted gate stood ajar. Beyond it, the silhouettes of trees reached upward, skeletal branches intersecting the sky like veins in marble. The traveler hesitated, counting his heartbeats, as the city’s silence deepened, becoming something tangible. Summoning courage, he entered.</p><p>The world within the park was not entirely asleep. Crows nodded on their perches, tracking him with obsidian eyes. A fox, halfway between dusk and dawn, flickered across the path like a memory vanishing with first light. Shadows pooled around Andrei’s feet, thickening with each step he took. He was aware, keenly so, of the soundless pressure of the moon above. There were stories of this park, stories of dreams both lost and returned. Yet Andrei had never believed himself a candidate for visitation—he was a vessel for other people’s tales, a silent witness.</p><p>He reached the heart of the park, an open circle of ruined columns where moonlight condensed, visible as mist. The air shimmered. Andrei stood at the edge, an outsider looking in.</p><p>“Come closer, moonlit traveler,” a voice invited.</p><p>He hesitated again. The voice was neither male nor female, neither young nor ancient. It slid beneath his skin, echoing in the empty rooms of memory. Andrei found himself unable to resist, stepping into the circle, feeling the temperature shift—warmer than the autumn air, tinged with a scent both sharp and nostalgic. It was halfway between cold stone and the fir resin of his childhood.</p><p>He watched, transfixed, as the mist thickened. Islands emerged—fragments of the world stolen by dreams or perhaps birthed by them. A forest sinking into brackish water, an ironclad train crossing endless plains, a woman dancing in an opera house ablaze with lights. All of them shimmered, uncertain in their reality yet more vivid than the city beyond the park.</p><p>&ldquo;You have journeyed far,&rdquo; the voice whispered, &ldquo;but you no longer know why.&rdquo;</p><p>He almost replied. He almost confessed to the thousand empty stations, the names of towns blurring together, the weeks when all he could taste was ash. Instead, he remained silent. The mist, taking silence for assent, spun faster. The circle was now a vessel of old echoes. In each image, Andrei recognized pieces of himself—a scarf left in a carriage, a coin pressed into a grateful palm, a half-finished letter sealed behind a forgotten stamp. How many lives had he wandered through, and how many dreams had he collected?</p><p>&ldquo;You have become the thread,&rdquo; the voice continued, its origins unplaceable. &ldquo;But a tapestry of wanderings is unfinished without its final purpose.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And what is my purpose?&rdquo; Andrei’s voice was dry from disuse.</p><p>“To remember,” the voice replied. “To dream the last dream.”</p><p>The mist parted, laying bare not visions of other lives but a singular, pristine memory—one untainted by the years he’d spent moving. He was no longer a man, but a boy, standing at the edge of the Irtysh River as ice broke between floes. His grandmother’s voice called him home, warm bread waiting. The world had not yet become cruel with distance.</p><p>The boy knelt to pick up a stone. He recalled, impossibly, its color—a blue paler than robin’s eggs, veined with white. He remembered wishing to keep the stone forever, to root it in memory so nothing would be lost, not time, not warmth, not love. Then, inevitably, he lost it in the dark, the memory scuttling to the bottom of the riverbed.</p><p>Andrei wept—not from grief, but from the sudden, overwhelming relief of remembering what he’d tried so hard to forget: he was not a ghost of the railway, nor a faithless collector of other people’s stories. He was a human being who had loved, who had yearned for home.</p><p>“You cannot return,” the voice warned, kind this time, “but you may rest.”</p><p>The moon burned cold above, a watchful guardian. The mist shimmered around Andrei, steadying him as exhaustion collapsed his knees. He lay back among roots and dew, cradled by memory. Around him, the dreams of others spun and soared, seeking their lost travelers, their own last dreams. Time hiccuped, sliding gently into another rhythm. For the first time in decades, Andrei slept without expectation, a traveler finally surrendering to home’s final horizon. He dreamed not of distant roads or unfathomable cities, but of the boy by the river, forever holding his blue stone, sunlight bending between clouds.</p><p>When the sun finally rose, the city felt different. The park’s mist had lifted; a sense of completion hung in the air. Where Andrei had lain, there was a faint impression in the grass, no more. Somewhere on the wind, the echo of old footsteps lingered—a promise that every journey ends with a memory reclaimed, that the moonlit traveler’s last dream is not of departure, but of return.</p><p>That morning, a fox paused on the path, tail curled like a question mark, sniffing the air. It glanced at the empty circle of columns, then trotted away, its silent agreement echoing: the final dream, at last, had been dreamed.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/magical-realism/>Magical Realism</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-last-dream-of-the-forest-a-magical-realism-fable/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Last Dream of the Forest: A Magical Realism Fable</span>
