The city&rsquo;s glimmering skyscrapers mirrored their piercing eyes, as cold as the Diablo steel they wielded. They were a legend in their own time, an urban legend whispered in back alleys crisscrossed with paranoid mutterings.</p><p>Our blind bandits, led by the enigmatic Nova and his first mate, Gemini, stood atop the most secure fortress known to man: Fort Knox, home to America&rsquo;s gold reserves. A fortress of concrete and poor planning-thanks to its single glaring blind spot in the eastern blockade, hallowed ground to these new underworld kings. It was the eve of the worldâ€™s second great depression, and Fort Knox was on the chopping block. The once impregnable fortress was now taunting the grim specter of bankruptcy from within.</p><p>&ldquo;We can do this,&rdquo; whispered Nova, his eyes locked onto the great wall that was Fort Knox. &ldquo;Trust your instincts.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Easy for you to say,&rdquo; whispered Gemini, a spastic shadow of the man he once was. The inky night swallowed his words.</p><p>The bandits formed two rows, equaling twenty in number. At a silent signal from Nova, they scurried down the face of the wall, inserting themselves between the barbed wire like a chameleon between the leaves of a papaya tree.</p><p>As they approached the grandiose gates before them, the Blind Spot Bandits suddenly froze. Burrowed in the minds of the bandits was a sense of foreboding dread, an auditory hallucination that screamed a warning. The rustling of leaves? An eerie dirge of an approaching storm? Or perhaps, a barely audible step drawing near?</p><p>The Blind Spot Bandits dismissed the noise. They knew that fear was the enemy, a sabotaging force intent on dethroning them from their rightful place in history. With rehearsed precision, the thieves carefully inserted code-breaking devices into the central control that would allow them entrance to the very heart of Fort Knox.</p><p>Except the control was offline. Nova pressed his ear to the central computer bank, and heard the virtual hum not of electronic static but of the ineffable silence, an augur of chaos. The preparation that had made the Blind Spot Bandits invincible in their every escapade failed them now in this moment. They were prey to their own cannon fodder.</p><p>The keystroke echoing through the fried network reverberated through the walls like an aberrant heartbeat. The Blind Spot Bandits watched in horror as the high-definition security screens flickered, morphing into distorted death masks.</p><p>Just then, a gold-plated roomba screeched to a halt before them, its bulbous eyes blinking petulantly. Within seconds, the roomba gave an inquisitive chirp, as if it were acknowledging their presence.</p><p>What followed was a tempest of confusion as the Blind Spot Bandits stumbled into the revealing spotlight of the robot sentinel. The fortress gates opened.</p><p>Before more chaos could ensue, the stricken group of thieves split, fanning out and disappearing into the shadows like spilled ink. Nova turned to Gemini.</p><p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t&mldr;&rdquo; Gemini whispered, eyes wide and mouth hanging agape.</p><p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t count on the roomba,&rdquo; Nova retorted with a stiff chuckle.</p><p>Inignant motley colors, an elder rat emerged in their matters present. The rats, a sly brigade hitherto unnoticed by the thieves, made their entrance comically entwined among the roomba&rsquo;s gears. The notion of the furry albatross twined so shamelessly upon the roomba, a mechanical sentinel.</p><p>In panic, the nervous rodents scattered, leading the Blind Spot Bandits right into the triangle of a resounding alarm that bellowed through the night.</p><p>Fighting the urge to flee, Nova commanded a swift retreat, desperately plotting their escape while avoiding tripping any more of their silent traps. They scurried like children, in the throes of an invisible hand that manipulated every grotesque twist and turn.</p><p>The desperate escape led them to a curvaceous adobe structure, worn and wooden, haphazardly sprawled like an abandoned oil spill outside the grand sculptures of art that adjoined Fort Knox. Door creaked open with the wizened reek of rust and the stale odourous scent of ghosts. Here, nestled between the shadows, nestled this rogue safe haven, known only as The Blind Spot Guesthouse.</p><p>Gemini raced inside, colliding with Nova as they fumbled for the lock. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re trapped!&rdquo; he exclaimed, his voice secondary to the thunderous symphony of sound that emerged from Fort Knox&rsquo;s belly.</p><p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; growled Nova, just managing to slip the lock&rsquo;s mortise.</p><p>The moment the door slammed shut, a deafening explosion engulfed the air, dwarfing the silence that had previously stolen the breath from their lungs. The Blind Spot Guesthouse&rsquo;s foundations trembled as its walls quivered, whispering promises of instability to itself.</p><p>Refuge found in the safe haven, the thieves breathed deeply, composed themselves. Electricity surged back to life, their gear awakening gently in the quiet way gadgets accept liberties. The mishap was transformed into an apparency of collateral damage.</p><p>As the sun swallowed the remaining darkness, they set their course, toward an uncharted city where adulation awaits us, toward Gotham, the nest of heroes, where our pestering doubts would find an audience. The Blind Spot Bandits accepted their decree, knowing the next time they would stand victorious, adorned in accolades, resplendent in their defeat.</p><p>As the city swallowed the darkness that once sought to abide by its scurry, the Blind Spot Bandits vouched never again to underestimate the might of technological failure-not along with a petulant roomba. And so their legend grew, more twisted than fate intended, and the Blind Spot Bandits became more than thieves. More than specters of the night. They were now kings of their proverbial robbing crusade, against forts, fears, and eventually themselves.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/robbery-and-heists/>Robbery and Heists</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/blind-fortune-mastering-the-art-of-stealth-robbery/><span class=title>Â« Prev</span><br><span>Blind Fortune: Mastering the Art of Stealth Robbery</span>
