Its name is whispered among sailors, treasure hunters, and scholars – San Jorge – a place hidden from the eyes of the public, a fortress of secrecy cloaked in veils of wind and rain.
A Generation of Family Lies
Rising above the sugary sand are the weathered remains of crumbling stone buildings that once formed an ancient village, now swallowed up by a maze of jungle plants and a history shrouded in legend. The inhabitants left behind the abandoned settlement a decade ago, seemingly overnight, only to leave rumors of cursed temples, haunted springs, and ancestral treasures that will forever be their secret. The local rumor mill was fuelled by mysterious disappearances in the years previous, the echoes of screams resonating across San Jorge like wails from otherworldly angels.
Thirty years of the island's occupation had built around the crumbling shell of an airfield and dock, left unused since its conversion to an eco-resort which catered specifically to an island elite and local fishermen, making it hard for outsiders to enter. No information about its population or occupation methods was found and the mysterious community was the greatest enigma wrapped in secrecy among the local waters.
It starts with rumors circulating among locals.
From fishermen to archaeologists, from fortune hunters to urban explorers; all claimed, at some time or another, to have uncovered a thread into the web spun by San Jorge's forgotten guardians. Each led to the question: who controls the flow of information from beneath the sand covered island, when the winds above whisper truths far from its unassuming form.
No wonder, many asked, if anything was being searched for – gold, lost artefacts, maybe even lost islands – hidden beneath a crust of dirt was the reason some people got desperate enough to believe in anything hidden beneath. Desperation brings even the sanest of men – and women to the darkest end of sanity: the desperation had been in one place since one of them whispered the legend a decade ago, the first day of what looked like an unforgettable storm in the unaccounted and never recorded night at the local cove of Mayaguana 1992 and the rest only knew a lot of lost items and no other information of people who ever did anything of similar nature ever reached the land at the local lighthouse after another storm a long time after then.</p><p>There exist stories from these people's dreams, all as vivid and dark as those moments of terror a decade past before the great fire that turned abandoned buildings to stones and char**.
This past night before had been so eventful it might have marked just the first stroke of what it would have one day turn.
All is not well - there were fires, lost towns, but for the past eleven years of continuous storms&mldr;
People who'd survived the calamitous night still trembled as dark memories took charge of their past, only trying to bring people together through storytelling and local mythology**.</p><p>As soon as night's veil dropped gently over San Jorge, darkness transformed the abandoned dwellings, twisting shadows of houses into haunting demons.
Night Has Fallen, Dreams Are Shining
No time to tell was left – storms were near in the form of a heavy weather system predicted just hours ahead on the news but it could hardly be called normal. Storm names were called a day after from the mainland authorities, it began to dawn how the past seemed to want control over its memory. Winds swept across San Jorge, shroud the place in what seemed an impending doom of massive proportions and left the entire isle on life support with storms raging at different levels – night and day no longer different because of constant raging storms which destroyed the balance but still it waited for an approaching storm in wait.
From the shadows an old story unfurls.
Thirty years have transpired, people have died on the island who were seen getting lost or murdered, others drowned in its tempestuous, unpredictable sea of waves crashing high against walls of weather – the unseeable darkness before the day arrives.
What is said - if even a fragment had been taken on the journey or if anyone came back alive will never be asked - or so some hoped. This kept the whispers burning, stories handed down and then passed around without any verification process. These mysterious tales about things that made the place beyond the point to be found safe only caused more problems at the cusp of new century.
But San Jorge wasn't the first instance of lost settlers. Before an island can leave behind stories enough to turn those who try leave it and want to keep looking for clues around it with less than hope about the fate at the local cave of Guayas, many tales of disappearance resurfaced a decade later&mldr;</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/hidden-treasures/>Hidden Treasures</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/buried-secrets-unearthing-hidden-treasures-of-history/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Buried Secrets: Unearthing Hidden Treasures of History</span>
