The Harsh Realities of Racial Prejudice</h1><div class=post-description></div></header><figure class=entry-cover><img loading=eager src=https://stories.googlexy.com/images/racism-and-prejudice.jpeg alt></figure><br><div class=post-content><p>The old oak tree in Elmsville Park had watched decades of history unfold in its shade—children laughing, couples strolling hand in hand, arguments whispered in hushed tones. There were moments of connection, moments of division; the tree saw it all. Beneath its sprawling canopy, Marcus leaned back against the rough bark, his eyes scanning the horizon with unease. The warm breeze that danced through the park seemed at odds with the heaviness in his heart. This wasn’t his first time feeling the weight, nor would it be his last.</p><p>Elmsville was a picturesque town at first glance, all neat lawns, tidy storefronts, and friendly smiles. Yet Marcus had come to know what simmered beneath that polished façade. As a community leader and third-generation resident, he saw the same racial prejudices manifest over and over again, sometimes in blatant outbursts and other times in subtler ways.</p><p>Five years ago, Marcus had moved back to Elmsville after college, partially out of a sense of duty. He wanted to make a difference, to prove that even in a town slow to change, progress was possible. He had worked as a mentor for underserved youth and organized forums where residents could discuss race relations. Despite his efforts, he often heard the same refrain: &ldquo;We don’t see color here. We’re colorblind.&rdquo; The sentiment was framed as virtuous, yet Marcus knew better; pretending racial differences didn’t exist was simply another way to ignore the systemic issues at hand.</p><p>This morning had been one more reminder of that reality.</p><p>It started with an email. Marcus had organized a community event for local small business owners, hoping to bring greater opportunities to minority-owned enterprises in the area. The initiative was met with overwhelming support—at least at first. But objections began trickling in one by one.</p><p>&ldquo;Why do we need to divide businesses by race?&rdquo; someone asked in the thread. &ldquo;We’re all the same here. Shouldn’t we focus on the universal struggles of business ownership rather than singling anyone out?&rdquo;</p><p>Then another voice chimed in, agreeing. And another. Before Marcus could write his response, an inbox flooded with opposition awaited him. By the time the Zoom meeting rolled around that evening, the undertone was clear: many attendees objected not because they wanted unity, but because they wanted silence. Recognition carried responsibility, and responsibility was what so many were unwilling to bear.</p><p>As Marcus sat cross-legged beneath the oak tree now, his thoughts drifted back to his late grandfather. A proud man by necessity, his grandfather had worked tirelessly as both an auto mechanic and an advocate for racial justice during the Civil Rights Movement. &ldquo;Always hold your head high, son,&rdquo; he’d told Marcus one summer afternoon, the scent of engine grease clinging to his fingertips as he flipped through weathered history textbooks. &ldquo;They’ll try to look through you, try to pretend you don’t exist. But you remind them who you are. You remind them every time you walk out into the world.&rdquo;</p><p>Marcus had inherited that sense of pride from his grandfather, but what would he have said about accusations of being &ldquo;too divisive&rdquo;? His grandfather had been called far worse words, but at least there were no illusions about the hate back then. Instead, it was laid bare, something tangible with roots Marcus could rip away. The sanitized rhetoric of Elmsville’s self-proclaimed “colorblind” culture threatened to bury those roots in layers of soil, masking the harm but letting it flourish just the same.</p><p>“Marcus?” A familiar voice pulled him out of his thoughts.</p><p>He turned, spotting Felicia approaching, a brown satchel slung across her shoulder. She was wearing a sunflower-yellow blouse, one that practically shone under the afternoon sun. Felicia was his closest friend and had been since they were kids. Though she had spent years away from town building her photography business, she’d never hesitated to lend her voice to Marcus’s work whenever she could.</p><p>“You alright?” she asked, plopping beside him in the dirt without hesitation. A faint wrinkle creased her forehead as her eyes studied him.</p><p>“Not really,” Marcus admitted, his tone heavy. “Meeting went worse than I expected.”</p><p>Felicia didn’t respond immediately, arranging her thoughts with the care Marcus admired. “What happened?”</p><p>“They don’t understand. Or maybe they don’t want to.” Marcus’s jaw tightened. “I hear ‘colorblind,’ and it makes me want to scream. They act like ignoring racism erases it. Like pretending differences don’t exist fixes anything. Meanwhile, businesses owned by folks like us are struggling just to stay above water.”</p><p>Felicia blew out a long breath. “It’s easier for them to normalize the status quo. Acknowledging racism means admitting their part in preserving the system—and nobody likes to be the bad guy in their own story.”</p><p>Marcus nodded, turning her words over in his mind. Felicia’s blunt honesty always cut through to the truth. “It feels like a battle I’ll never win.”</p><p>“That’s just it,” Felicia replied. “It isn’t about winning every battle. We’re here for the long fight, right? Sometimes it’s a small step. Sometimes you only reach one person at a time. But that doesn’t mean the work’s worthless.”</p><p>Marcus wished he had her steady conviction. For him, it felt like walking through quicksand: days of pushing forward, only to be dragged back by resistance or indifference. He wanted change now. It was hard to preach patience when the cracks were so visible.</p><p>“I had this family come through the studio last week,” Felicia said suddenly. Her voice softened as she shifted into storyteller mode. “Biracial couple and their son. After the session, the mom was telling me about how nervous she felt taking family portraits in a town like ours. She said she was worried people would stare or make a comment. But I told her she didn’t need to hide. I told her that a picture’s power isn’t just about who takes it—it’s about who insists on being seen.”</p><p>Felicia’s words hung in the air; the same pride Marcus’s grandfather had spoken of pulsed there too. He realized that change wasn’t about sweeping moments—it was about steady persistence. It wasn’t about convincing everyone in Elmsville overnight, but providing even one person the courage to claim their story.</p><p>“This is why I keep showing up with you to those meetings,” Felicia continued, nudging him lightly. “Because if we don’t fight for spaces to exist—if we don’t challenge them to see the realities we aren’t ‘colorblind’ to—then who will?”</p><p>Marcus stood, dusting the dirt from his jeans. Felicia followed suit, stretching her arms skyward beneath the tree’s shadow. “Alright, what’s next?” Felicia asked with a brave smile.</p><p>Marcus smiled faintly in return. “Lunch,” he said. “Then tomorrow, we fight some more.”</p><p>The two walked away from the oak tree that had witnessed so much history. In their footsteps were heavy memories, but also seeds of hope planted and nurtured with each effort. Elmsville, with all its cracks, wasn’t unchangeable. Marcus knew that stubborn perseverance was often the first answer to deeply rooted injustice.</p><p>For as long as the old tree stood, it would witness their fight to cultivate something different. Something better. Something that not only acknowledged the colors within the world but embraced them unapologetically.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/racism-and-prejudice/>Racism and Prejudice</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/colorblind-the-journey-toward-overcoming-racism/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Colorblind: The Journey Toward Overcoming Racism</span>
