Gallow Cottage stood in a secluded part of Weatherbury, its patchwork roof and ramshackle structure swallowed by the overgrowing vegetation that plagued the desolate landscape. It had been years since a soul had walked these cobblestoned pathways, and the only company the ancient man had now were the squawks of the crows and the rustling of the leaves.</p><p>Old Mr. Finley sighed, the weight of the family secret pressing ever harder against his weary shoulders. He&rsquo;d waited long enough to pass on the mantle of laughter to the newest heir, and now was the time to do so. One last time, he trudged up the broken stairs to the creaky door, and let out an echoing laugh that sent the birds fleeing in terror.</p><p>Inside, the dim candlelights illuminated a scene fit for an absurdist play. Dusty upholstery furniture adorned the main hall, fake roses withered on the chandeliers, and draped tapestries with stains from ancient wars. A grotesque guitar in the corner, nose hairs visible through the cracks of missing strings, teetered on a stack of 78-rpm records, its strings silently pleading for absolution for the desolation it once played for a world untouched by tragedy.</p><p>At last, the door creaked open, revealing the scene of the century. Giggling youngsters, armed with books, tomes, and costumes made of recycled flora and rusted iron, played out a pantomime of unsuspecting grandeur. A mischievous young boy stood with a hunk of bread on his head, toppling out of Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels, performing a solo pantomime about a humble baker seeking his place in the world. Behind him, the castle he had carved was a monument of pastiche fun, its walls resembling a less authentic Stonehenge, with errant shards of colored glass littering the ground.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, there you are!&rdquo; Old Mr. Finley exclaimed, his voice carried through the hall by a blast of charisma built from years of guffawing and mystique. The stunned children, bottom lips quivering from overexcitement, turned to face him.</p><p>&ldquo;Welcome, my young friends, to the seventeenth annual Gallow Comedy Festival. I have something to say before our main entertainer takes the stage.&rdquo; He bent down, adjusting one of his missing eye patches with mechanical dexterity.</p><p>&ldquo;You all know I&rsquo;ve been keeping a secret all these years. Well, every five generations, a heir to the Gallow Estate is chosen not based on birth or heritage, but on their uncontrollable laughter amidst adversity. The ability to uplift even the most unfortunate of souls with the power of humor. That&rsquo;s precisely why I chose you all.&rdquo;</p><p>A mix of gasps and coos rippled through the excited children.</p><p>The old man limped towards the stage, his cane tapping with what appeared to be a metronome of self-doubt and accomplishment. &ldquo;Can you all feel it?&rdquo; he cried, and the children nodded fervently. &ldquo;That laughter you share, the story you tell, this is your birthright. To find joy in the shambles of Gallow Cottage.&rdquo;</p><p>Then, he turned to one of the children, herself a scrawny, hyperkinetic dynamo. &ldquo;Eliza, the Honorable Heir of Humble Abode and Mistress of our Realm, are you ready to take your place?&rdquo;</p><p>A face-splitting grin illuminated the child&rsquo;s shocked features. She hopped from one flabby leg to the other before taking a graceful bow to her trembling audience.</p><p>&ldquo;Now, let the Festival of Laughter commence!&rdquo;</p><p>Untethered cheers erupted, uniting the children, echoing through the crumbling walls, and transcending the grief and shame that had once suffocated Gallow Cottage. The fattest man of old times stumbled through the halls and mocked the pain in his distorted joints, drinking each joke like water from the Fountain of Strength. A woman, a lonely widow, wept silently at the sight, witnessing a miracle as her daughter cured her ache with laughter.</p><p>The children bounced from room to room, their improvised, gut-busting comedy pages flipping to new chapters of whimsy - one little girl, in a dusty, worn-out mother&rsquo;s dress, capered back and forth, her make-believe &ldquo;magic cures all&rdquo; potion causing the children to explode into laughter each time they received a sip from her cup.</p><p>To their pure delight and astonishment, Eliza suddenly appeared by the stage, a radiant queen in a crown of bittersweet flowers and a gown made from scavenged ribbon. She climbed atop an overturned wooden bucket, her voice growing by leaps and bounds.</p><p>&ldquo;If laughter is your strength, let it never shrink to a mere whisper.&rdquo;</p><p>And so, the most uproarious festival in all of Weatherbury bore the stamp of Eliza&rsquo;s laughter, her fabled descent from the dusty bloodline of the Gallow Family a true spectacle, a masterpiece selected by destiny. And the seed, so ignored by scholars and family alike, flourished at last.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/comedy-and-humor/>Comedy and Humor</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-hilarious-escape-of-the-worlds-worst-spy/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Hilarious Escape of the World's Worst Spy</span>
