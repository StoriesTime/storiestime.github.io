The <strong>Compass Rose Tavern</strong> came to be known as the only place in existence where time, space, and everything in between met to share tales spun from the very borders of the multiverse. It was said that anything in the vast span of time and space could find its way into this fabled establishment, and it was here that Ollie, our jovial yet bewildered bartender, served his eclectic patrons.</p><p>Ollie&rsquo;s knowledge of the comings and goings from different dimensions and timelines was vast and fluid, much like the ever-shifting seas of a ceaseless cosmic ocean. One evening, as the chatter of time travelers swirled around him, filling the air with shared experiences, unspoken destinies, and whispered secrets from a billion different points in history, Ollie felt a different energy near the bar.</p><p>He turned and saw a strange dimming phenomenon lurking just within the entrance, like a pocket of smog from a bygone industrial era swallowed by ceaseless time. The air shimmered before coalescing into a figure, who regarded Ollie with amiable curiosity.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah,Greetings, Traveler!&rdquo; Ollie spoke, tipping his hat forward as if to better analyze his unexpected guest. &ldquo;From whence do you hail?&rdquo;</p><p>Before the visitor could respond, the smoggy outline of his form swirled once more, swirling into a vortex of uncertainty. Cries of dismay erupted from the guests as the ink of the universe threatened to swallow the tavern whole, and the air around them thickened with the gravity of Turning Tides.</p><p>The patron spoke up, his voice just above the murmuring panic of the onlookers. &ldquo;Fear not, dear sirs and ladies! My name is Cyrus, and I hail from the Dimension of Lost Futures.&rdquo; His form further solidified, and Ollie extended a hand in greeting. &ldquo;As for what brought me here…well, it&rsquo;s a tale I&rsquo;ve never shared before.&rdquo;</p><p>With a flourish, Ollie pulled out a glass for Cyrus, intending to pour him a drink from the ever-shifting contents of the Compass Rose Tavern&rsquo;s bar. But instead of liquid, a maelstrom of swirling cosmic winds emerged with each pour, reflecting the emotions and desires of the bar&rsquo;s inhabitants. Ollie watched in awe, and Cyrus smiled knowingly.</p><p>&ldquo;Not only does this tavern unite the eras, but it also unites messages,&rdquo; he observed, swirling the winds in his glass.</p><p>&ldquo;Infinite conversations, poured into the depths of this cosmos-infused elixir,&rdquo; Ollie said in amazement, &ldquo;and you, sir, have set foot upon its edge.&rdquo;</p><p>An event unfolds in this tale, a hidden secret that Russet, a clockmaker from the Third Millennium, has been unraveling for centuries. He&rsquo;d designed his creations in reverse, stepping back through time, as it were, in order to comprehend the impetus of time itself. Russet had abandoned his own time, traveling too far along the dual-edged routes that he&rsquo;d woven together with his hands, and had concurrently unraveled the fabric of his existence.</p><p>Having left pieces of himself scattered all around the multiverse, Russet drifted into the inn one evening. The patrons glanced upon him with a mixture of fascination and fear. The man&rsquo;s very essence had become a tapestry of temporal wounds, and yet, he carried a message—trapped within the Clockmaker who had become a Chrono-Path/ic wanderer.</p><p>Cyrus, seeing Russet&rsquo;s predicament, offered a helping hand-a timely drink, filled not with the swirling winds of the cosmos, but with the temporal paradox of Russet&rsquo;s very existence. The Clockmaker took a sip, and suddenly the temporal wounds began to close.</p><p>With each passing moment, Russet found his essence knitting back together, filled with an inexplicable urge to return home. Even as his time was restored, the experiences he&rsquo;d gleaned from beyond the edge of time altered the course of his life. Where once he had been a distant and cold clockmaker, he suddenly embraced the warmth of the present, leaving behind the hazardous journey that had led him to this tavern.</p><p>Andrus, a fellow apothecary, took notice of Russet&rsquo;s transformation. Realizing the potential in Cyrus&rsquo;s concoction, he vowed to collaborate with Ollie and learn of the complex nature of time and space in order to better harness its power within his potions and elixirs.</p><p>The tavern came to life with new purpose, as patrons and inhabitants from across the multiverse shared their experiences and sought better understanding of the very fibers of time. Gaians, Lumina, Reavers, and countless others through the ages found a sense of unity within the Compass Rose Tavern as they sought the answers left unchecked in countless pages of history.</p><p>Ollie, Cyrus, Russet, Andrus, and the Earth of Turning Tides had become ties that bound the multiverse together. Their efforts would ultimately reveal the great truth of existence, hidden within the tales spun at the edge of the multiverse.</p><p>And thus, the Compass Rose Tavern drew to its core, all the great truths and prophecies, the stories and tales that still echo within the hearts of time travelers in every age. It became a beacon of unity, an anchor to the might of infinity within the vast and myriad cosmos, drawing from the edge of the multiverse, and toward a new age. A new era, the other side of Eternity.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/time-travel-and-alternate-realities/>Time Travel and Alternate Realities</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/blip-in-the-matrix-an-unpredictable-reality/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Blip in the Matrix: An Unpredictable Reality</span>
