However, standing alone on my rooftop, surrounded by the quiet of the night, I felt a sense of solace wash over me. A chill ran down my spine as the cool breeze carried the whispers of strangers, their hopes and dreams flowing like the urban streams that traversed the city's labyrinthine streets.
I had hidden above the concrete jungle for hours, gleaning away from the concrete and steel edifices, but embracing the serenity it held within its sprawling expanse. For tonight, at the heart of winter's darkened grip, I had joined a community of solo dwellers who sought isolation and introspection at this isolated urban borderland. We quietly milled about in our hidden world on high – sometimes we'd converse softly into our phones as people around us moved in sync with other dreams.
Beyond the expanse of rooftop structures around me stood the glinting backdrop of the night sky – clear enough for me to gaze deep into the firmament in search of infinity. Upon looking out across the majestic skyline, rising from towers of stately grandeur, glinting windows seemed reflected in the street lights opposite: they lit neon stars twisting horizontally. As far as I could behold, I saw cities spread out according to their design principles.
Cars, trucks, taxis, passersby slipped below while trains rattled down corridors away into quieter twilight that shrouded the faraway lights all across these different places. However far these street scenes stretched out before me, it seemed isolated. These impressions became reality once more – lonely echoes reverberating off isolated, unseen city faces below me on the chill city sidewalk which shone and reflected light from high night lights across the silent night hours.
High above all of this, watching out across vibrant stretches of an entire city still beating at every pulse down at each one of those wraith-like silhouettes was more empowering than I anticipated it would be. Watching how energy from the many different metropolises I was looking out upon appeared from beneath multiple windows shone like an unrivaled, flickering moon.
Each window's whisper echoed softly at a very far distance amidst that dissonant orchestra. Below various light-lit roof-tops glistened and were part of moving clouds and dark formations. Far beyond numerous buildings my friends or colleagues lived on different high roof-tops while far below I was able to spot children playing late games of their own with dancing shadows as my silhouette observed an unending expanse of sparkling glass skyscrapers. Enveloped in thoughts and shrouded around me it loomed all-around where night stars drifted closer and their sounds could come sharply closer: in each every neighborhood under that powerful night sky metropolitans seemed each one their own one world, a small piece of it.
Each one lived out life at a great distance, their vibrant glimmer afar – to be able ever still – no signs upon the entire vast urban landscape now went yet entirely immersed within its constant twilight night flow. Strangers above walked, some solitary ladders turned a turn downward towards their specific destinies below while people strolled just short distances ahead, moving through even more crowded and restless nights – each unique to those walking so innocently outside on that silent night below the rooftop level was life on their own different stage.
Rooftops. I appreciated these. Each high rooftop is sanctuary above above towering skyscrapers. It was like standing at peak heights against all skyscrapers, a detached bubble which detached myself from this far-flung, cosmopolitan borderland but their own world they shared as they traversed metropolitan streets from here above.
I held still in this skywalk on high. Cladding came down as I breathed fully in the atmosphere which enveloped the city on this wintry night in hushed, chilly town silence. People out moved silent within light-lit silhouettes from afar down on the pavement while it undeniably appeared once much less loud now: an unwieldy, bustling world whose lonely lights stretched as quiet infinity across what now appeared mostly quieter outside of this tranquil elevated isolation.
Each distant roof hung on edge delicately under endless night - this whole city felt a sky full above. Faint hushed, lonely, silent tones sounded soft below and at edges while watching the deep and wonderfulness world of life streaming just a bit beyond rooftops felt soothing.
Tonight for an untold amount, walking out here in a serene, peaceful rooftop world atop our wondrous, enchanted metropolis brought me solace not seen upon any street day yet came to my awareness what our isolated rooftop heaven once again reminded me when as night silence deepened low and deeper the city walked one more step.
From now I stay.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/urban-life-and-cityscapes/>Urban Life and Cityscapes</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/rooftop-reflections-short-stories-of-urban-solace/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Rooftop Reflections: Short Stories of Urban Solace</span>
