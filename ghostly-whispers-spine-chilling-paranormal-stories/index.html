A soft, almost imperceptible moan slipped from the shadows, barely audible, but enough to send a chill crawling up the spine of anyone who dared to listen. The moon hung high in the sky, casting its cold, silvery glow across the landscape, bathing everything in a haunting light. Beneath that glow, the abandoned house stood, its crumbling walls and broken windows telling the tale of years spent forgotten by time. Yet, something within those walls refused to be forgotten.</p><p>It was an old farmhouse, long since deserted by any living soul, yet the air around it seemed thick with a presence, something dark and ancient, something unwilling to let go. Locals had whispered about it for years, warning strangers to stay away, to never set foot near the house after nightfall. They spoke of strange happenings: flickering lights in the windows, chilling voices on the wind, and shadows that moved even when no one was there.</p><p>But for Lucy, a seasoned journalist with a penchant for the paranormal, such stories only piqued her curiosity. She had made a career out of investigating ghostly tales, uncovering truths buried beneath the myths. She had traveled to countless haunted locations, but none had intrigued her as much as this particular farmhouse. So, she decided to visit.</p><hr><p>Lucy arrived just as the last vestiges of daylight faded, the air growing cooler as the sun dipped below the horizon. She parked her car at the edge of the overgrown path leading to the house and stepped out, the crunch of gravel beneath her boots the only sound in the stillness. She adjusted her camera bag, checking to ensure that everything was in place. She had brought her best equipment: night vision cameras, voice recorders, and a digital thermometer to measure any sudden drops in temperature that might indicate the presence of spirits.</p><p>The house loomed before her, its silhouette dark against the dimming sky. The roof sagged in places, and the front porch creaked ominously with every gust of wind. As she approached the front door, the hairs on the back of her neck stood on end. Something about the house felt wrong, like it was watching her, waiting for her to make the next move.</p><p>With a deep breath, she pushed the door open. It groaned in protest, the sound echoing through the empty rooms beyond. Lucy stepped inside, the smell of mildew and decay assaulting her senses. The floorboards creaked underfoot as she made her way deeper into the house, the dim light from her flashlight barely cutting through the darkness.</p><p>The walls were covered in peeling wallpaper, remnants of a life long since abandoned. She wondered who had lived here, what their stories were, and why they had left. The whispers of the past seemed to linger in the air, like unfinished conversations between the living and the dead.</p><p>She took out her voice recorder and began her usual ritual: “This is Lucy Harrison, here to investigate the paranormal claims surrounding the old farmhouse on Hollow Hill. I will be documenting any unusual activity throughout the night.”</p><p>As she moved deeper into the house, she felt a shift in the atmosphere. It was subtle at first, a sense of being not quite alone. She turned a corner, finding herself in a narrow hallway with doors on either side. One door stood ajar, its frame warped with age. The faintest sound, like a soft sigh, drifted from within the room.</p><p>Lucy hesitated, then pushed the door open, her flashlight illuminating a small, dusty bedroom. The bed was covered in tattered sheets, and a cracked mirror hung crookedly on the wall. But it was the corner of the room that caught her attention. There, in the farthest corner, stood an old rocking chair, its wood worn and chipped.</p><p>Without thinking, Lucy approached the chair. As her footfalls echoed in the silence, the temperature in the room seemed to drop, the air turning colder with each step. She could feel it now, the unmistakable presence of something—someone—watching her.</p><p>Suddenly, the rocking chair creaked. At first, she thought it was the wind, but then the chair moved ever so slightly, rocking back and forth as if it were being gently pushed by invisible hands.</p><p>Lucy froze, her heart pounding in her chest. She quickly pulled out her thermometer. The temperature had dropped several degrees in an instant. She quickly began recording the moment, her breath visible in the cold air.</p><p>“Is anyone here with me?” she asked, her voice trembling slightly.</p><p>For a long moment, there was only silence, save for the soft rustling of the wind outside. But then, from deep within the house, came a whisper. It was faint at first, so soft she almost couldn’t hear it. But it grew louder, clearer.</p><p>“Help me…”</p><p>The voice sent a wave of ice through Lucy’s veins. She turned, scanning the room with her flashlight, but there was no one there. The voice had been unmistakably human, though there was something off about it—an unnatural quality to the way it echoed through the walls. It seemed to reverberate, as if coming from the very bones of the house itself.</p><p>Lucy’s instincts screamed at her to leave, to turn and run, but her curiosity kept her rooted to the spot. She checked her recorder, hoping to capture the voice for later analysis. But before she could speak again, a sudden gust of wind blew through the open window, extinguishing her flashlight. The room plunged into darkness.</p><p>Her breath quickened as she fumbled for her spare flashlight in the bag. Her fingers brushed against cold, damp wood, and the faint sound of something dragging along the floor reached her ears. She froze. The dragging sound grew louder, closer, until it seemed to be right behind her. Then, a voice—low, guttural, and full of malice—whispered in her ear:</p><p>“Leave… now…”</p><p>Her blood ran cold. She turned, expecting to find nothing but the empty darkness behind her, but instead, she saw a shadow—a figure standing in the doorway. The figure was tall, its features indistinguishable in the dark, but its presence was undeniable. It stood perfectly still, watching her, as though waiting for her to make a move.</p><p>Lucy’s heart raced, her body frozen in place. She wanted to run, to flee from the oppressive atmosphere of the house, but her legs refused to move. The figure stepped forward, its footsteps heavy and deliberate, echoing through the silence of the room.</p><p>It was then that Lucy saw it—the faintest flicker of light coming from the corner of the room, near the rocking chair. The light grew brighter, swirling, twisting, until it took on the form of a woman—a figure, translucent and glowing, her face twisted in pain.</p><p>The woman’s mouth moved, as if trying to speak, but no sound came from her lips. Instead, the whispers returned, growing louder, more frantic.</p><p>“Help me… please…”</p><p>The figure reached out a hand, her fingers stretching toward Lucy. But as she did, the temperature plummeted, the air thickening with a suffocating presence. Lucy’s flashlight flickered, and in that instant, everything seemed to distort—the walls closing in, the floor shifting beneath her feet. The woman’s outstretched hand seemed to grow longer, its fingers curling into a grotesque shape.</p><p>With a desperate cry, Lucy backed away, her legs finally finding the strength to move. She stumbled backward, the room spinning around her. The whispers grew louder, a cacophony of voices now swirling in her ears, urging her to stay, to listen, to understand.</p><p>“Leave… or never return…”</p><p>The last whisper was a command, and with it, the pressure in the room broke. The temperature returned to normal, and the eerie presence lifted as quickly as it had come. Lucy, breathless and trembling, stumbled toward the door, her body trembling from the aftershock of what she had just experienced.</p><p>As she exited the room and made her way back through the house, the whispering voices faded, leaving behind an oppressive silence. The rocking chair had stopped moving. The room was still. But Lucy knew she had encountered something that couldn’t be explained, something far beyond the reach of any logical investigation.</p><p>Outside, the wind howled once more, as if to remind her that some stories, some spirits, were never meant to be understood.</p><p>As Lucy drove away, the house behind her receding into the distance, she glanced in the rearview mirror. For just a moment, she thought she saw a shadow in the window. The whispers of the past calling her back, forever bound to the haunted halls of the farmhouse on Hollow Hill.</p><hr><p>And so, the story of the ghostly whispers continued, passed from one generation to the next, an eternal reminder that some things in this world should never be disturbed.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/supernatural-and-paranormal/>Supernatural and Paranormal</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/ghostly-whispers-short-supernatural-stories-to-keep-you-up/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Ghostly Whispers: Short Supernatural Stories to Keep You Up</span>
