Not at her mother’s kitchen table where the pressure cooker huffed, and not at school, where Mrs. Barlowe’s voice droned like the radiator, predictable and faintly menacing. Still, her mind fizzed with them: Where does cinnamon come from? Why do shadows stretch at dusk? What’s inside the eyes of a blue jay? She pressed her tongue behind her teeth whenever these questions welled up in class. There was learning—quiet, dutiful rows of it—and there was wondering, messy and sprawling, which wasn’t nearly as rewarded.</p><p>One sticky spring morning in third grade, curiosity slipped past her guard. While Mrs. Barlowe traced long division on the chalkboard, Odessa, transfixed by a beetle blowing across her desk, raised her hand. &ldquo;Why do beetles have the shiniest shells? Is it so birds won’t eat them?&rdquo;</p><p>Silence. Ten identical heads turned, and Mrs. Barlowe, straightening her skirt, replied, &ldquo;Hold your questions until after the lesson, Odessa. Right now, we are learning division.&rdquo;</p><p>But the question itched. Odessa spent recess in the library corners, plucking encyclopedias from the dust. She learned about Darwin’s beetles, about camouflage and predators, and about bioluminescence. By the time she returned to class, she felt stuffed with something electric. It pulsed through her hand as she wrote: curiosity can turn a question into a lantern—one that never lets you walk in the dark.</p><p>Years slipped quietly, one after another. Middle school enveloped Odessa in a fog of rigid schedules and circled Scantron bubbles. Curiosity became a sort of contraband, traded in whispers and notes passed under desks. The world became a study of how not to get in trouble: raise your hand only for the right answer, memorize facts and spill them back, don’t admit you are still wondering.</p><p>In Mr. Labonte’s science class, the script was almost always the same. Notes on photosynthesis, the life cycle of frogs, then review packets for the test. But in October, Mr. Labonte brought onions, potatoes, and bits of fruit for them to examine with hand lenses. “This is stupid,” moaned a boy across the aisle, but Odessa leaned close, seeing a jagged jungle living on the onion skin. “You want to know why the cells are shaped that way?” Mr. Labonte asked, catching her stare. When Odessa nodded, he smiled—not the tired, patient smile adults used on children, but a true one, full of conspiratorial delight. “Try to find out. The lab is open after school.”</p><p>It was the first time she’d been invited—truly invited—into the business of wondering. Odessa stayed late that day and many days after, her questions multiplying, wild and unashamed. She pored over microscopes and drank in library books. Mr. Labonte sometimes had answers; more often he had suggestions for what to try next.</p><p>By the end of eighth grade, Odessa’s room looked like an alchemist’s lair: petri dishes on the dresser, moth wings pinned to cardboard, binders full of notes and strange spidery diagrams. Her mother scolded her for the mess, but something had clicked inside Odessa—something irreversible. Learning felt less like marching and more like running, barefoot and laughing, into the tide.</p><p>High school was a bigger ocean, and curiosity was somehow both easier and more dangerous there. Classes splintered into tracks. Counselors spoke of AP courses and college acceptances as if the world hinged on them. Curiosity, when out in the open, sometimes earned derision:</p><p>“Another one of your weird questions, Odessa?” Kelly sneered during biology, and everyone snickered as Odessa raised, then lowered her hand. The social calculus was simple: invisibility beat ridicule every time.</p><p>Still, she couldn’t turn down the volume on the internal radio of her mind. At home, under the safe glow of her bedside lamp, she chased answers. Why do we dream? How do migratory birds navigate across continents? What is entropy really? She wrote emails to scientists, some of whom replied with entire paragraphs, their excitement seeping through her screen, encouraging her to keep searching.</p><p>Curiosity, Odessa discovered, was not an entirely safe trait for a teenage girl. It upset the sage order of things. But it also cracked the world open and let the dazzling air in.</p><p>Her senior year, Odessa submitted a proposal for an independent research project—an investigation into the language of crows. Despite being told it was too ambitious (“You can’t train crows, Odessa. They’re wild animals!”), she set up a network of perches and hidden cameras in the woods behind her home. She mapped flight patterns, recorded squawks and caws, experimented with food lures. Her results, far from conclusive, were messy and thrilling. She didn’t care that her data was full of holes. She cared that she’d entered the crows’ universe, if only for a moment.</p><p>During graduation, while caps sailed through the muggy air, she felt a pang of loss—what if college would be all lectures and requirements, no room for improvisation or failure?</p><p>But college in the city pulsed with questions, an embarrassment of them, flapping and flocking down every hallway. In the philosophy department, professors argued about paradoxes as if they were chess masters, and every library carrel was stacked with half-read books on topics Odessa hadn’t known existed: ethnomusicology, quantum computing, the neuroscience of memory.</p><p>College was also the first place where she met people for whom curiosity was not only permitted but demanded. There was Avi, who built robots out of junkyard scraps; Marisol, who debated poetry over ramen; Signe, a pale-skinned Dane who hunted meteors in the country fields on weekends. They compared obsessions and swapped theories late at night on the dorm roof, the sky blazing with city light, new constellations of friendship kindled by inquiry.</p><p>Of course, not every class stoked her fire. Some were rote drills, mad dashes for grades, stern warnings to play it safe. But Odessa sought out the teachers who snickered at rigid syllabi, the ones who said, “Let’s see what happens.” With Professor Wescott, she explored the philosophical roots of science—why do we believe things at all? With Dr. Amin, she traced climate models and asked: How does one person’s curiosity save a world in danger?</p><p>Internships followed—one at a bird sanctuary, where she helped design new habitats, another at a think tank analyzing how curiosity-driven research led to medical breakthroughs. The pattern was always the same: a question, a chase, a web of new questions generated in the process.</p><p>Odessa carried her curiosity like a torched lantern into her first job: a science writer at a digital magazine. Every week, she pitched stories that began with wonder: Why do fireflies synchronize? Who built the world’s oldest libraries? How did people imagine the future in 1900? Her curiosity infectiously drew in readers who’d never cared about beetles or entropy.</p><p>She was not always rewarded. Editors sometimes wanted something slicker, punchier. “Can you make it simpler? Less weird? More viral?” Odessa nodded, obliging, but she kept sneaking questions in, pocketing them like bright stones for later.</p><p>One day, an email arrived. It was from a fifth-grade teacher in Minnesota, who had assigned her article on urban crows to an unruly classroom. “They didn’t know science could be like this,” he wrote. “They’re making crow feeders now—one of them saw a beak by the window. Thought you should know.”</p><p>Odessa sat for a long time, letting that sink in. She thought of her own childhood teachers, the ones who welcomed questions and the ones who did not, and how each moment of encouragement had added a pulse to her journey.</p><p>She started to imagine—then actively pursue—a new project: interviewing people whose lives brimmed with curiosity, from tattoo artists to paleontologists to city engineers who mapped invisible rivers beneath skyscrapers. She called the series “WONDERING PEOPLE.” The first podcast episode featured Professor Wescott recounting his first philosophy class, comparing it to “falling down a rabbit hole and forgetting how dark the world had seemed before.”</p><p>The audience grew. Curious kids tuned in. Retired teachers shared stories. A stranger wrote from New Zealand: “You made me remember how much I used to love asking questions. I’ve gone back to school. Thank you.”</p><p>A pattern revealed itself in the stories: curiosity was seldom about dazzling intelligence or even encyclopedic memory. It was about seeing gaps and wanting to peer inside—not being frightened by the unknown, but inviting it in for tea.</p><p>Odessa never stopped collecting questions. Even as her career grew, even as she became a teacher herself, guiding students who hid their questions like secrets. She told them what Mr. Labonte had told her long ago: “Try to find out.”</p><p>The questions they asked—sometimes clumsy, sometimes Annoying, sometimes profound—built a room of light in her classroom. If they learned nothing else, Odessa hoped they’d hold onto that room. She hoped the world would never convince them that learning was something simple and clean, instead of the glorious, tangled wonder she’d chased all her life.</p><p>Learning, she understood, was not a river with a beginning and end. It was a web, spun from question after question, glinting in the sun, stretching further than anyone could see. And curiosity was the thing that kept the web growing, shimmering with possibility, bright enough to guide anyone bold enough—or foolish enough—to ask what else was possible.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/education-and-learning/>Education and Learning</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-power-of-a-teachers-words-a-journey-of-knowledge/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Power of a Teacher's Words: A Journey of Knowledge</span>
