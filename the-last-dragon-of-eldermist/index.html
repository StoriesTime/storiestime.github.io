It was a secret wrapped in the whispers of the wind, the rustling of leaves, and the distant roars of a creature thought to have been forgotten by time. That secret was the Last Dragon.</p><p>The world had long since believed dragons were nothing more than myths. Stories of their great wings, fiery breath, and the awe they inspired were told by children at campfires and elders in the village tavern. But deep in the heart of Eldermist, far beyond the reach of any map or kingdom, the Last Dragon remained hidden from the eyes of men—until the day it was destined to be found.</p><hr><p><strong>The Prophesy</strong></p><p>It began, as many great tales do, with a prophecy.</p><p>In the village of Mossbury, nestled on the edge of the Eldermist range, an old sage named Thalia had spent her years studying the stars. It was said that she could read the very movements of the sky, interpreting the celestial bodies like an ancient language no one else could understand. She spoke little, but when she did, the words carried the weight of the universe. One fateful evening, when the moon was full and the winds howled through the narrow streets, Thalia gathered the villagers in the town square.</p><p>“The last dragon will awaken when the world needs it most,” she said, her voice like the rustling of dead leaves. “A child born of fire and water shall rise, and the dragon shall come forth to either save or destroy. The choice will not be theirs alone.”</p><p>The villagers, most of whom had heard the stories, laughed nervously, thinking it nothing more than another of Thalia’s cryptic riddles. But there was one who listened closely—young Eamon, a boy with eyes like the storm and a heart full of wonder. He’d heard the stories of the dragons as a child, and while most of his peers dismissed them as fanciful tales, he always felt that somewhere deep within the folds of Eldermist, something waited, something ancient and powerful.</p><p>He did not know it then, but Thalia’s prophecy was about him.</p><hr><p><strong>Eamon’s Journey</strong></p><p>Eamon had grown up in Mossbury, the son of a blacksmith and a healer. His parents were practical folk, focused on the everyday tasks that kept the village alive. But Eamon was different. His thoughts often wandered to places far beyond the forge and the herb garden. He would sit by the river, gazing into the mist-covered peaks of Eldermist, and wonder if there was truth to the tales.</p><p>On the night of his sixteenth birthday, something changed. As the full moon rose, casting a pale glow over the valley, Eamon felt a pull—a strange, almost magnetic force that drew him toward the mountains. It was then that the dream came to him.</p><p>In his dream, a dragon of silvery scales and emerald eyes spoke to him. Its voice was both thunderous and soothing, like the rumble of distant storms and the whisper of leaves in the wind.</p><p>“Eamon,” it said, “you are the one. The time is near. Come to me.”</p><p>He awoke with the dragon’s words echoing in his mind. The next morning, without a word to his parents, he packed what little he could carry and set out toward the heart of Eldermist. He didn’t know where he was going, only that the dream was a call he could not ignore.</p><hr><p><strong>The Path Through Eldermist</strong></p><p>The journey through Eldermist was treacherous. The fog was thick, so dense that it seemed to have a life of its own, swirling around Eamon’s legs and making it impossible to see more than a few feet ahead. The trees loomed like ancient sentinels, their twisted branches reaching down to grasp at him. Strange creatures, whose eyes glowed like lanterns in the night, watched him as he passed, but none dared approach.</p><p>For days, Eamon wandered deeper into the valley, following an unseen path that seemed to reveal itself only when he was about to lose hope. It was as if the land itself was guiding him, pushing him forward toward something that had been waiting for centuries.</p><p>On the seventh day of his journey, Eamon found it—the heart of Eldermist.</p><p>A great cavern opened before him, its entrance hidden by a curtain of hanging vines. The air inside was cool, and the silence was deafening. As he stepped inside, he felt the weight of centuries upon him. The walls of the cavern shimmered with an ethereal glow, reflecting light from some unknown source deep within.</p><p>And there, at the center of the cavern, was the Last Dragon.</p><p>It was enormous, its wings folded neatly against its sides. Its scales shimmered like polished silver, and its eyes—green as the deepest forest—watched Eamon with an intensity that sent shivers down his spine. It was a creature of power and wisdom, ancient beyond imagining. The very air around it crackled with magic.</p><p>“You have come,” the dragon said, its voice resonating in Eamon’s chest. “I have waited.”</p><hr><p><strong>The Awakening</strong></p><p>The dragon, whose name was Cyrax, spoke of a time long past, when dragons roamed freely across the world, their presence a source of awe and fear. But as the ages passed, men grew fearful of their power. Wars were waged, and the dragons were hunted to the brink of extinction. Cyrax was the last of his kind, hidden away in Eldermist, where no human could reach him.</p><p>But now, with the world teetering on the edge of great change, Cyrax had awoken, and Eamon had been chosen to fulfill a destiny neither of them fully understood. The prophecy had been clear: Eamon was the child of fire and water, the one who would either save the world or doom it.</p><p>Cyrax explained that the balance of the world was faltering. The forces of light and darkness were growing ever more intense, and the dragon’s power, which had once kept the world in harmony, had waned over the centuries. Only by awakening the dragon’s magic could the balance be restored.</p><p>But there was a choice to be made. Eamon could use the power of the dragon to restore balance and peace, or he could unleash a storm of destruction that would engulf the world. The prophecy had not said which path he would choose—it was a choice that lay solely within him.</p><p>“I will not force you to decide now,” Cyrax said, his voice a soft rumble. “But the time will come when you must choose. The future of the world rests in your hands.”</p><hr><p><strong>The Battle for Eldermist</strong></p><p>As the days passed, Eamon learned the ways of the dragon. Cyrax taught him how to harness the elemental forces of fire and water, earth and air. Eamon grew stronger with each passing day, feeling the magic of the dragon fill his very being. But with this power came a growing sense of responsibility. He knew that whatever choice he made, it would affect not only his life but the lives of all those he loved.</p><p>Then, the day came when the skies darkened, and the earth trembled. Forces of darkness, led by a mysterious and powerful sorcerer, descended upon Eldermist. They sought to capture the dragon and use its power for their own purposes.</p><p>Cyrax stood tall, his wings unfurling to their full span. Eamon stood beside him, his heart filled with both fear and resolve. The battle for Eldermist had begun.</p><hr><p><strong>The Final Choice</strong></p><p>The battle raged for hours, the forces of darkness clashing against the power of the dragon. Eamon fought alongside Cyrax, using the magic he had learned to defend the land. But as the battle wore on, Eamon realized the true nature of the choice that lay before him.</p><p>In order to defeat the darkness, he would need to use the full power of the dragon—to unleash a force so great that it could obliterate the invaders and restore balance to the world. But in doing so, the dragon’s magic would be spent, and Cyrax would fade into legend, his power lost forever.</p><p>Eamon stood at the precipice of that choice, the weight of the world upon his shoulders. He could save Eldermist and the world, but in doing so, he would lose the dragon forever.</p><p>With a final, determined breath, Eamon made his choice. He called upon the power of the dragon, channeling it through his own body. Fire, water, earth, and air erupted in a magnificent storm of energy, striking down the forces of darkness and restoring peace to Eldermist.</p><p>As the last of the invaders fell, Eamon turned to Cyrax, his heart heavy. The dragon, with a final, knowing look, nodded.</p><p>“You have made the right choice,” Cyrax said, his voice a fading echo. “Now, the world will be free.”</p><p>And with that, the Last Dragon of Eldermist faded into the mists of time, his magic becoming part of the land itself.</p><hr><p><strong>Legacy</strong></p><p>Eamon returned to Mossbury a hero, but his heart was heavy with the knowledge of what he had lost. The village grew and prospered, the peace he had fought for lasting for generations. But as the years passed, the stories of the Last Dragon faded into legend, and the world moved on.</p><p>But in the hearts of those who remembered, in the whispered winds of Eldermist, there was a silent, eternal reminder: the Last Dragon had once lived, and he had been a part of a world that would never forget.</p><p>And as for Eamon, he grew old, his hair turning silver, but his heart always carrying the memory of the dragon, and the choice he had made that would shape the future for all time.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/mystical-creatures/>Mystical Creatures</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-lamenting-lighthouse-mysteries-of-the-melusine-mermaids/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Lamenting Lighthouse: Mysteries of the Melusine Mermaids</span>
