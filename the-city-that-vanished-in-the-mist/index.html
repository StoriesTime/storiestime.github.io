It was called Mirathis, but few alive could tell you exactly where it lay. The City that Vanished in the Mist was more legend than fact, a place often dismissed by cartographers as a product of overzealous imaginations and elaborations passed down through the centuries.</p><p>Yet, for Cade Harlow, it wasn’t a story. It was an obsession.</p><p>Cade’s fingers hovered over a water-stained map spread on the creaking table of the Jester’s Lantern, the small inn he’d been holed up in for weeks. Beneath the dim glow of an oil lantern, the map looked ancient. Drawn with exquisite precision, it detailed the northern coastline of the moorlands, jagged cliffs fading into the endless stretch of gray-green ocean. Cade’s focus, however, was on the faint markings at its edge. There, in tiny, almost imperceptible script, was the one word he had spent years chasing: <em>Mirathis</em>.</p><p>He traced the outline of the markings with his fingers, as if expecting the map to reveal its secrets through touch alone. His companion leaned against the doorframe, watching him with an expression somewhere between amusement and concern.</p><p>“You do realize most people think this city never existed, right?” Elena drawled, arms crossed over her weathered leather jacket. A rogue and relic hunter by trade, Elena had joined Cade’s expedition out of curiosity—or so she claimed.</p><p>“I know what the sailors in Brackenridge said,” Cade replied without looking up. “They’ve all seen the same thing. Banks of mist that roll in faster than a gale, the sound of bells, and shadows—huge towers rising out of the fog before disappearing again. It’s out there.”</p><p>“Bells and shadows. Very convincing evidence,” Elena quipped. “What about the other stories? The ones that say anybody who finds Mirathis… never comes back.”</p><p>Cade raised an eyebrow and smirked. “You’re still here.”</p><p>Elena rolled her eyes but didn’t reply. They both knew she wasn’t going to back out—not now, not when they were this close.</p><hr><p>The journey began the next morning. Cade, Elena, and the three other members of the expedition—a navigator named Orin, a grizzled sailor called Thatch, and a scholar named Lysara—set off at dawn aboard the <em>Windspire</em>, a sturdy brigantine built for endurance. They sailed west, following the coastline until it gave way to the boundless waters of the Veiled Sea, so named for the perpetual fog that clung to its surface.</p><p>For days, they navigated the dense mist. It was unlike anything Cade had ever seen; the fog was thick enough to taste, carrying with it a briny scent that clung to their clothes and hair. It muted the world around them—the rhythmic creak of the ship’s timbers, the groan of ropes straining against the wind, even their voices. The crew moved like ghosts aboard a phantom vessel, each caught in their own silence as the sea stretched into infinity.</p><p>And then, on the fifth day, they heard the bells.</p><hr><p>Soft at first, almost indistinguishable from the hum of the waves, the sound steadily grew louder. It was a deep, resonant tolling that seemed to reverberate through the very bones of the ship. Cade stood at the prow, his heart hammering in his chest as he peered into the fog ahead. Beside him, Elena shaded her eyes, squinting into the haze.</p><p>“I see something,” she murmured.</p><p>At first, Cade thought it was another trick of the light, the way the mist played with perception and turned clouds into towering shapes. But as the <em>Windspire</em> drifted closer, he saw it—shadowy spires breaching the fog like leviathans rising from the deep. The bells tolled louder now, a solemn dirge that echoed across the waters.</p><p>“Mirathis,” Cade whispered.</p><p>The city was beautiful, and it was broken. Rising from an island carved out of jagged black rock, Mirathis seemed to belong to another age entirely. Winding bridges arched over canals that shimmered with a silvery light not of the sun or moon. Towering spires of marble and onyx twisted toward the heavens, their tips hidden by the ever-shifting mist. Statues lined the waterfront—weathered figures of robed scholars, warriors, and creatures Cade couldn’t quite name. There was no movement, no sound but the bells, and no sign of life.</p><p>Cade turned to Orin, who stood frozen at the helm. “Take us closer,” he whispered, but before the words had fully escaped his lips, the ship jolted violently.</p><p>They had hit something.</p><p>Thatch and Elena rushed to inspect the side of the ship while Cade leaned over the railing, peering into the dark water. He saw nothing at first, just the glassy surface of the sea rippling beneath the fog. But then, something moved. A pale shape flashed beneath the waves, gone as quickly as it had appeared. Cade recoiled, his mind flickering back to the old tales of guardians that were said to protect Mirathis—creatures half stone, half flesh, bound to the city for eternity.</p><p>“That’s not good,” Thatch muttered as he returned from below deck. “We’ve got a crack in the hull. If we don’t land soon, we’ll be taking on water.”</p><p>“There’s no turning back now,” Cade said. “We row to the city.”</p><hr><p>They boarded the longboat in grim silence, paddling through the silver-gray waters toward the looming shadow of Mirathis. By the time they reached the docks, the sound of the bells had faded, replaced with an eerie stillness. The air was thick with an unnatural cold that sank into their bones, and Cade felt a creeping unease as he stepped onto the cracked stone of the city’s edge.</p><p>The streets of Mirathis were labyrinthine, twisting in ways that defied logic. Crumbling archways formed tunnels that seemed to lead nowhere, and the buildings leaned at angles that made Cade feel as if the entire city would collapse on itself at any moment. In the distance, a massive central spire rose into the mist, its silhouette dominating the skyline.</p><p>“This place feels… alive,” Lysara said quietly. She ran her fingers along the stone of a nearby wall, her scholarly curiosity shining through her fear. “The architecture is… fluid. It’s as if it’s shifting while we walk.”</p><p>“It’s not just the architecture,” Cade said. Something had been gnawing at the edge of his perception since they’d arrived—an unsettling awareness of being watched.</p><p>As they ventured deeper into the city, they began to notice things. Strange things. A set of footprints in the dust, leading in a perfect circle. A statue that seemed to have moved when no one was looking. A flicker of light in the corner of Cade’s eye that disappeared when he turned his head.</p><p>“Does anyone else feel like we’re not alone?” Elena asked, her voice trembling despite herself.</p><p>Before anyone could answer, the ground beneath them trembled.</p><hr><p>It began as a low rumble, then grew into a roar. The stones of the street cracked, and from the fissures, a thick gray mist began to swirl. It coiled around them like living tendrils, and as it did, Cade saw shapes forming within it—vague, humanoid figures with hollow eyes and gaping mouths. The bells began to toll again, their somber toll resonating with an almost oppressive weight.</p><p>“Elena, run!” Cade shouted, grabbing her arm and pulling her toward the central spire. The rest of the group followed, their footsteps echoing in the empty streets. The mist-creatures gave chase, their forms shifting and reforming in ways that defied natural law.</p><p>They reached the spire’s entrance just as the first of the mist-creatures lunged for them. Cade slammed the heavy iron door shut and leaned against it, panting. They were safe, for now.</p><p>Inside, the spire was cavernous. Intricate carvings covered the walls, depicting scenes of what looked like a thriving city. People danced in grand halls, scholars held scrolls aloft, and warriors stood guard over a swirling orb of light at the center of it all.</p><p>“That’s it,” Lysara said, pointing to the orb in the carvings. “That’s what powered this city. If we can find it—”</p><p>“We <em>leave</em>,” Elena interrupted. “I’m not dying here because of some ancient relic.”</p><p>“We’ll never make it out through the mist,” Cade said quietly. “Our only hope is to find it. If the legends are true, it can dispel the mist.”</p><p>“And if the legends aren’t true?” Elena asked.</p><p>Cade didn’t answer. He didn’t have to.</p><hr><p>Hours later, they stood in the spire’s heart—a vast chamber bathed in an otherworldly glow. There, suspended in the air, was the orb. It pulsed faintly, as if alive, its surface swirling with light and shadow.</p><p>“Careful,” Cade said as he approached it. He reached out a trembling hand, and the moment his fingers brushed the orb, the world went white.</p><hr><p>When Cade opened his eyes, the mist was gone. The city of Mirathis lay in ruins around them, silent and still. The bells had stopped.</p><p>And the city had vanished once again.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/magical-realism/>Magical Realism</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-city-that-never-slept-magical-realism-short-stories/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The City That Never Slept: Magical Realism Short Stories</span>
