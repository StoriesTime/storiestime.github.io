Dr. Evelyn Cole pressed her palm to the cold glass, heart pounding as the numbers on the monitor blurred, re-calibrating with each flicker. Outside, rain streaked the window, thrumming a staccato counterpoint to the pulse of the quantum engine.</p><p>“Energy spike in subspace field,” intoned Simon, her taciturn research partner, his eyes locked on a bank of color-coded graphs. “Readings are anomalous.”</p><p>“You mean beautiful,” Evelyn murmured, voice trembling on the cusp of awe and dread. She glanced at her own reflection: wild curls, rimless glasses fogged, cheeks hectic from adrenaline. A physicist halfway down the rabbit hole, staring into paradox. She had always relished impossible questions, but since Project Grazing’s first breakthrough, the impossible had crept off formulas and strode, bold and corporeal, into her lab.</p><p>The machine whined, crescendoing to a note so high it hurt. Shadows warped above the containment tank, and for an instant, she caught the echo of another world—a city skyline painted in lavender dusk, their own Cambridge fractalized with impossible hills and a thread of neon canal. The vision blinked out as quickly as it had come.</p><p>Simon was tapping furiously. “System integrity holding, but… variables are cascading.” His brow furrowed. “We’re not alone in the stream anymore.”</p><p>Evelyn steadied herself. “It worked, then. We’ve achieved quantum divergence.” She said it softly, reverently, letting the phrase settle in the air.</p><p>Simon eyed her with uncertainty. “You realize what that means, don’t you?”</p><p>Her mind spiraled through the implications: timelines splitting, branching, then reversing their course to collide. Infinite versions of their world, overlaid by mathematical possibility. Collisions of “what-ifs,” the universe’s own experiment with causality.</p><p>Before she could respond, a shape took form inside the cylinder—a figure, blurry, graceful, limbs limned in trembling light. Evelyn staggered backward, hand to her chest.</p><p>The figure resolved: a woman, shockingly familiar, but not quite her. The hair shorter, jaw more angled, a tiny scar carving her left eyebrow.</p><p>The other woman stared at Evelyn through the glass, her expression a tapestry of horror and wonder.</p><p>Simon whispered, “Is that…?”</p><p>Evelyn’s mind whirled in recognition, dread warring with fascination. “It’s me. Or, at least, a version of me.”</p><p>The glass between them felt thinner by the second. The other Evelyn’s eyes roamed the lab, fixing on the control panel beside Simon.</p><p>Inside the cylinder, the doppelgänger moved her lips: At first, no sound. Then, through a harmonics spillover, a double-voiced phrase materialized, impossible yet unambiguous.</p><p>“Stop the engine.”</p><p>Evelyn felt Simon’s eyes on her, searching for a solution, an instruction, anything. Instead, she pressed closer, palm flat to the cylinder. She mouthed—“Why?”</p><p>A rapid shimmer—images stacking upon one another, like the aftereffect of trying to look directly at a strobe. Her counterpart’s gaze sharpened, pleading. Then the power dipped, and quantum interference sprayed the room in flickering afterimages: a hundred Evelyns, each fragmentary, vanishing like ghosts.</p><p>The machine rattled. Monitors flashed red.</p><p>“Containment is failing,” Simon barked.</p><p>Evelyn’s mind rocketed through probabilities. They’d theorized that contact with a divergent self might cause timeline resonance—a feedback loop, capable of annihilating both worlds. But to meet herself, from another course, another quantum toss of the cosmic die… to have confirmation, proof—</p><p>She flicked a switch. The engine powered down by half, subluminal fields collapsing. The alternate Evelyn faded, then snapped into sharp relief. Only this one now, no more overlapping specters. The glass separating them glowed with an algae-green haze.</p><p>Her double pressed hand to hand with Evelyn, only inches apart.</p><p>“My world—” the doppelgänger spoke, the distortion now a trembling quaver—“is unraveling. We collided in phase space. The paradox is killing us both.”</p><p>Simon’s tone sliced through the standoff. “We need to reset the isolation field or we’ll trash not just these two timelines, but maybe every adjacent vector. It’s not just about us anymore.”</p><p>Evelyn nodded. The academic in her craved answers, but the person—the self—ached at the chasm unfolding between every heartbeat. She watched her alternate self reaching out, desperate, the same curiosity, fear, hope.</p><p>“What do I do?” Evelyn’s voice broke, as much demand as plea.</p><p>The other Evelyn’s eyes flashed. “Sever the tie. Destroy divergence node. Close the loop before the waveform collapses us both.”</p><p>Could she? Was she willing to give up the opportunity of a lifetime—the ultimate experiment, the grail quest for what lay beyond the bounds of her own existence?</p><p>She ran an inventory of her mind: mother’s laugh lines, father’s quantum puzzles, the clink of mugs in quiet evenings, Simon’s exasperated sighs, every small, precious moment that made her Evelyn.</p><p>She decided.</p><p>She raised her hand to the main abort lever, locked eyes with her counterpart, then Simon.</p><p>“Ready,” Simon said, holding his breath.</p><p>“Go,” whispered the other Evelyn. Grief and gratitude threaded through the simple word.</p><p>Evelyn pulled.</p><p>The quantum engine screamed. A kaleidoscope of realities spun through her—brief, intoxicating, each world a potential: Evelyn the novelist, Evelyn the failed physicist, Evelyn who’d never left home, who loved other people, other places, other possibilities. Grains of experience, scattering in the current.</p><p>Then, a wrenching detachment—a universe exhaling. The light died. The air stilled. Glass and metal and equations returned to their familiar, singular selves.</p><p>Evelyn bent over, clutching her knees, retching up half-forgotten dreams.</p><p>Simon slid to the floor beside her, their trembling hands tangling in comfort or panic—she couldn’t say which. In the lab’s silence, the only sound was her own ragged breathing.</p><p>“She’s gone,” she choked.</p><p>Simon nodded, face pale, eyes shadowed. “System records are… inconsistent. It’s almost as if… it never happened.”</p><p>Evelyn crawled to the engine console, hands moving by rote, reading lines of data that now meant something else: impossibility, rewritten behind her eyes.</p><p>Outside the rain had stopped. The city was the city again, without lavender glows or impossible angles—reassuringly mundane. Evelyn pressed her brow to the window, feeling as if the world itself held its breath.</p><p>Simon joined her, shoulder to shoulder. “You think that was the end?”</p><p>Evelyn closed her eyes. Already, the vision of her counterpart was fracturing, slipping away. She suspected reality was reassembling itself, smoothing over the scars before anyone noticed.</p><p>No, not anyone, she corrected. Only her. Only Simon, and herself—the sole witnesses, perhaps, to an event that never technically occurred.</p><p>Yet she’d felt it, seen the tear in the fabric between futures. The cost of knowing: always memory, always doubt.</p><p>She let the silence settle, let the question live between them, unanswered.</p><hr><p>The next day, Evelyn sat at her desk, pretending focus, re-reading lines from her own notes, searching for traces of the divergence.</p><p><strong>Observational Log</strong><br><em>2:44 AM—brief anomalous energy signature; origin indeterminate</em><br><em>2:46 AM—quantum spike in harmony with secondary pattern</em><br><em>2:48 AM—unaccounted equipment activity; possible interference</em></p><p>Nothing. Clean, precise, sanitized by chronology.</p><p>She caught her own reflection—no scar, no flickered afterimage, just her. Except, not quite. There was an ache beneath her ribs, a memory without context, the uneasy sensation of ghosts inhabiting her bones.</p><p>Simon entered, carrying two mugs.</p><p>He set one beside her, and for a fractured second she recalled the synchrony—the way their hands had shaken together, on the precipice of something infinite and terrible.</p><p>He met her gaze. “Do you think… it’s really… over?”</p><p>“No.” She sipped her coffee, seeking words, finding only shapes and probabilities. “Once you’ve met another version of yourself, you can’t be whole. You’re forever split. Divergence is inside you now.”</p><p>He nodded, understanding.</p><p>Their work—for the moment—was in abeyance, the engine dormant, the project officially shelved.</p><p>But the world outside their window shimmered with possibility—rain slicked streets, the toll of a distant church bell, grass so green it threatened to fracture into new color.</p><p>They sat in silence, on the rim of all that could be, and all that almost was, the memory of quantum divergence burning quietly behind their eyes.</p><p>Every choice, every failure, every tiny miracle—now bled with a new, impossible shade: the knowledge that somewhere, sometime, another self might be staring back, hand pressed to the glass, each a wound in the fabric of reality, each a testament to the collision of timelines, and the fragile, beautiful terror of existing at the crossroads.</p><p>Outside, the rain began again, soft and infinite.</p><hr><p><strong>End</strong></p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/time-travel-and-alternate-realities/>Time Travel and Alternate Realities</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/portal-to-elsewhere-time-travel-and-parallel-worlds/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Portal to Elsewhere: Time Travel and Parallel Worlds</span>
