They trembled in the warm night breeze, rippling along the eaves. For generations—so far back his ancestors’ names blurred—someone in the Liu family had done this, welcoming the harvest, inviting ancestors’ blessing, and celebrating survival one more year.</p><p>In the autumn of 1966, the lanterns never made it out of their lacquered woodbox. Instead, they sat, silent as tombs, in the farthest corner of the house.</p><p>Liu watched them from the moon-washed threshold. They stared back, unlit.</p><p>He had heard the young voices in the distance—shouts, slogans, songs that galloped through the village by daylight, with ragged banners and drums of tin. In the schoolyard, walls that once carried the handprints of his own sons now bore slogans in bold strokes of red paint: “Destroy the Four Olds!” The youth spoke of a new world, stripped of old customs, ideas, culture, and habits.</p><p>Liu understood little about politics. He rarely left his village, and the world outside the crooked rice paddies was as remote as the sky. But he understood loss—the snuffing out of a way of life, as swift and unceremonious as a gust of wind.</p><p>For eighty years, he had performed his rituals. He had burned joss sticks before the family shrine, tended the thin, swaying reeds for his ancestors, and bowed beneath the heavy gaze of painted faces in ancestral portraits. His wife, dead now, had stitched his ceremonial jacket with minute, twisting stitches—a longevity knot woven at the cuff for protection.</p><p>He heard his grandchildren’s voices, bursting with a new accent, the clipped syllables of Beijing radio. “Grandpa, we’re not supposed to do that anymore. It’s feudal. Backward.”</p><p>But Liu’s memory moved in and out of time; he remembered other voices and other threats. Starvation years: Men swallowing bitter grass. Invasions: The roaring of foreign boots. He had lived through too much disruption, and yet the old ways, as persistent as river water, always seeped back in.</p><p>Now, change came not from outside, but from within. The bamboo lattice of his house seemed to shudder each time the children rehearsed their rallies, popped his heirlooms into rice sacks, or pried the calligraphy tablets from the altar and fed them to the courtyard blaze.</p><p>One evening, shouts scattered the quiet. Liu, in his plain blue coat, peered from his doorway. The Red Guards—teenagers, faces split into grins both joyous and hungry—marched house to house. They wielded brushes and hammers. They painted slogans on the lintels, tore off door gods, flung scrolls and carved lions into great communal fires.</p><p>His neighbor, Mrs. Zhang, sat outside with her shriveled dog, hands trembling as her mother’s incense burner was smashed against the stones.</p><p>A hush fell. Then a sudden bellow: “Here. More Four Olds!” A group had come to Liu’s gate.</p><p>A boy stepped forward—his eldest grandson. Eyes glittered behind thick-rimmed glasses.</p><p>“Grandpa, bring out the tablets. We’re cleaning out the feudal relics.”</p><p>Liu felt the air tighten. For a moment he clung to memory: rain thrumming on the clay tiles, his wife’s warm laughter, the safe hush of ritual. But there was no time for soft memories now.</p><p>He shuffled back inside. The ancestral tablets, lacquered in dusty black, still sat—old Han Chinese characters picked out in gold leaf, now faded to brown. His hands hovered. His grandson—a child who once chased fireflies in this very courtyard—stood at the threshold, an impassive sentinel for a new age.</p><p>With effort, Liu picked up the first tablet.</p><p>“Ye-ye,” the boy urged. “It’s time.”</p><p>They started with the ancestor whose face was barely remembered, then moved down the line: each tablet a century, each a family story. Liu’s hands shook, but he did not cry. Out in the yard, the Red Guards rummaged through his house, unspooling red banners and farm tools into a haphazard inventory of “Old Society.”</p><p>Fire lapped at the foot of the big jujube tree, as the shrine and scrolls, the lanterns and the tablets, disappeared in the flames. Acrid smoke curled into the night air. Liu’s grandson stood beside him, lips compressed, knuckles white.</p><p>It occurred to Liu then that a kind of forgetting was underway, deeper than surface destruction. In burning the objects, they erased not just things, but instructions for living—the choreography of small gestures, the dust of custom that coated every day.</p><p>When the last of the tablets collapsed into ash, the crowd cheered, chanting slogans of liberation.</p><p>Later, alone in the quiet, Liu surveyed the ruins. The house had lost its protective talismans; the joss paper heaped at his feet was just so much burned paper. He sat down, feeling a sudden, clear emptiness. Even grief seemed to have scorched itself out.</p><hr><p>The village staggered for a while in this new order. Liu’s rice field, stripped of ritual, was planted anyway. The harvest was neither better nor worse than before, but the meals at home grew quieter. After the destruction, Liu’s routine was hollowed out—no more dawn offerings, no midnight lantern lightings, no murmured prayers for the departed.</p><p>His daughter tried, in a whisper, to explain it to him. “It’s progress, Baba. We have to follow the Party. The Chairman says&mldr;”</p><p>Liu did not answer. Words felt too crude. Even his body, once so skillful at folding offerings or balancing the lantern ladder with a rooster cawing at his feet, now seemed to belong to a stranger.</p><hr><p>Seasons shed their layers. Red Guard armbands grew faded; the drums lost their thunder. One night, so many years on it was as if the world had spun around twice, a storm tore through the village. Tiles flew, trees snapped, and water rushed in the streets, carving new channels through the clay. Liu, now stooped and nearly blind, heard the wind and something like a voice crying out.</p><p>That night he dreamed: his ancestors, the whole lacquered procession, drifted past him in their old formal gowns, faces neither angry nor approving. His wife smiled at him across the gap of years. He awoke with the taste of burnt incense in his mouth.</p><p>When dawn came, Liu pulled out the last relic of the old world: one small paper lantern, forgotten at the bottom of a trunk. He barely recognized his own hands as they shook out its crumpled frame. The past was irreversible; there would never again be a crowded festival, a whole field glowing with lantern-light. But as the first sunrise in months limned the clay walls in honey, Liu struck a match.</p><p>The lantern burned quickly, a flare of ancient color against the gray light. Ash drifted onto the empty threshold.</p><p>He watched as the wind carried scraps of red far, far away—over the rooftops, over the fields, into the rising sun.</p><hr><p>Though the old traditions were shattered, their whispers lingered: in the memory of burned joss sticks; in the half-heard cant of prayer at dawn; in the callused hands of an old man, flaring hope briefly, as a lantern flickers at the edge of the storm.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/cultural-revolutions/>Cultural Revolutions</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/when-history-turns-a-page-the-power-of-cultural-overthrows/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>When History Turns a Page: The Power of Cultural Overthrows</span>
