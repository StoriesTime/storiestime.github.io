Known for his sprawling murals of human-sized blewits mushrooms and geometric portraits of unicycle-riding giraffes, Danny wielded his spray paints and stencils like a modern day Picasso, catapulting once lifeless concrete canyons into vibrant fields of artistic wonder. After all, as the 90s grunge scene had spit out plenty of misunderstood musicians, it bore just as many misunderstood artists who found solace in subverting conventional beauty standards.</p><p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t no thieving Pollock,&rdquo; Danny always chuckled, referencing the man who had famously flung paint from a whiskey bottle onto a canvas. &ldquo;I take time. I plan. I visualize. I breathe. I grow.&rdquo;</p><p>And Danny grew, both literally and metaphorically, through his art. Sprouting roots into the pavement and spreading tendrils above the city&rsquo;s towering skyscrapers, he became inseparable from his canvases. Those who knew him best however, knew it best not to draw attention to his…peculiarities. Outsiders and alone by choice, Danny sort of lived on the streets – sleeping amongst their shadows, feasting at their pedestrian dumpling food carts, and dancing at local Latino festivals. Always wary of the police and their dreaded helicopter, he became a master at vanishing into the city&rsquo;s concrete folds whenever the need arose.</p><p>&ldquo;Better to be naive than to recognize too much,&rdquo; he once said, his crooked smile shining against his disheveled beard. &ldquo;Finding beauty where and how you can is better than recognizing the broken glass beneath your feet.&rdquo;</p><p>But there was a price to be paid for Danny&rsquo;s artistic reign—his isolation. While his murals painted the city into an artistic utopia, he remained colorless in the societal spectrum, invisible even amongst the visible. Despite sharing his creations via covert means and maintaining tips from art enthusiasts, he never built the type of following that swelled public consciousness.</p><p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t no Van Gogh chasing admiring crowds in his asylum days,&rdquo; he scoffed.</p><p>One day during an unexpected downpour, Danny sought refuge beneath a small overpass in Lower Manhattan. As he contemplated the interlocking raindrops shimmer on an abstract figure he had just finished, he heard a chorus of footsteps approaching.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, hell no,&rdquo; he mumbled, making to pack up his paints. He had no intention of leaving any remnants of his work behind, lest it give away his whereabouts, something the art world would never comprehend.</p><p>But the sound was unlike that of any NYPD cruiser. It trampled through the puddles rhythmically, in a slow, deliberate cadence. Square-like, in fact. Suspicion piqued, Danny peered out from behind his palette.</p><p>Perched atop an elevated subway platform was a black unicycle. Beside it stood a tall figure. Even from a distance, he could make out the alleminative circles. Enormous mushrooms–of his own design–sprouted from the stranger&rsquo;s shoulders.</p><p>The mythical-looking creature spoke with a voice as deep as Danny&rsquo;s subconscious. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen your work. The unicycle could use a champion,&rdquo; it boomed, stalking closer towards the platform&rsquo;s edge.</p><p>In the minute that followed, all semblance of fear evaporated. Not only did this apparition mirror Danny&rsquo;s aesthetic parallels, but its very essence screamed &lsquo;outsider&rsquo; as loudly as he. Danny accepted the unicycle offered, and with one last exchange of respect, the mysterious figure faded amidst the petals of dusk light. From that moment on, Danny traded the clandestine strangeness of his art for a newfound confidence that breathed life into his wheelchair-bound legs. He could not halt the commendable, squeezing sensation that each bound brought forth.</p><p>Danny became the Illustrated Unicyclist, painting stories of resilience on streets once untouched. In a city full of expressionless walls, he carved an influential niche carved in stone–by choice, inevitably subject to unavoidable predetermination, firmament. Defying statuesque paradigms gave rise to a whirlwind of emotions that only fate could solve for, under the watchful eye of the stars that embellished their nocturnal throne over eager skies.</p><p>&ldquo;This is our unaddressed heritage, an associate of organic process left to the detached and unarranged man,&rdquo; said at long last the artist in his heart.</p><p>And it spread, like roots grounding and roots reaching.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/artistic-struggles/>Artistic Struggles</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-hidden-struggles-of-artists-short-fiction-on-creative-battles/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Hidden Struggles of Artists: Short Fiction on Creative Battles</span>
