No one knew of her extraordinary talent, least of all herself, for it appeared as if the stars had bestow their favor upon her birth in order to gift her such an unusual power. Little did anyone know that the girl, Eris, had unlocked a secret to the extraordinary; one that was to change the fate of the world.</p><p>Eris; a girl of quiet demeanor, with long flowing hair and eyes that sparkled like the ocean on a summer&rsquo;s day. Despite her 17 years on this earth, she remained a stranger to the violent storms that wrack the human spirit. Eris reveled in the beauty of the earth and all its small miracles and spent countless days and nights discovering the splendors of the wild and rugged world.</p><p>Eris lived with her family in a quaint cottage on the outskirts of the village. Surrounded by sprawling fields and lush woods, she spent her days wandering the land, seeking out the natural treasure the earth generously provided. It was on the banks of a murmuring brook that Eris first discovered the Vault - a magnificent underground cavern heretofore uncharted in all the land.</p><p>The Vault was the engineer&rsquo;s pride and joy - a veritable treasure trove of lush overgrowth and untold riches hidden in the depths of the earth. Eris was enthralled by the gleaming jade leaves and brightly colored flowers that lined the walls of the cavern, and she spent countless hours wandering amongst their splendor, taking in the cool embrace of the mist that perpetually hovered in its depths.</p><p>Then, one fateful day, as Eris ventured deeper into the cave than she ever had before, she stumbled into a small alcove, barely illuminated by the feeble light of a tiny naturally-formed skylight. There, in that forgotten and dusty corner of the earth, she discovered something that changed her life - and the fate of the world - forever. Resting upon a bed of moss lay a strange object, covered from head to toe in layers upon layers of mud and grime. It appeared a relic of some forgotten age; a tall, slender column of a thing, topped at its greatest height with a circular base.</p><p>Eris decided to bring the relic back to her cottage to examine, so as to restore it, clean it, and uncover its mysteries. Retrieving it from the Vault, Eris soon realized that she could move about with the most inconceivable grace and dexterity, barely making a sound. That day, as she emerged from the Vault, returning home with the relic, not a single person from the village noticed her. That is, until she carried the treasure into her home, the delicate truth spilled from her trembling lips, and the murmurings began.</p><p>The relic was a part of something much more grandiose than anyone had previously believed, a piece of a technology long-thought lost, an ancient artifact manned by a race long believed destroyed by time and the elements. Most scholars and historians, believing they had all the answers to the world&rsquo;s most ancient secrets, scoffed at the very notion, summarily dismissing Eris as nothing more than a flighty dreamer, albeit with a peculiar gift for stealth.</p><p>As the weeks turned into months and the relic remained unveiled in Eris&rsquo;s unassuming cottage, she began to utilize her secret gift to uncover more pieces - each coming from the most unlikely and hidden places imaginable. The people of the village began to take notice, their curiosity piqued, and the world as they knew it began to shift.</p><p>Eris approached the artifacts with a quiet reverence, desperate to piece together the extraordinary story that lay hidden amongst the fragments. As each piece of history was revealed, Eris gained a better understanding of her gift and the way it connected to something much greater, something of a higher power, indeed.</p><p>The people of the world had long been on the cusp of something extraordinary and momentous. Little did they realize their greatest work lay hidden, lost to the sands of time, only to be uncovered once again by a singular act of grace and tenacity. For what force in nature had granted Eris her remarkable ability to steal, unnoticed, as if she were invisible to the world?</p><p>As the sensation of Eris&rsquo;s unique gift spread through the world, others, young and old, the least likely of people, discovered within themselves abilities they never knew they had. Through this newfound awareness, they learned to harness negative energies into positive ones, weaving together the delicate dance of life and death.</p><p>It&rsquo;s in the moments when chaos reigns, when order and stability seem like futile dreams, the greatest beauty of the human spirit hides, waiting for the stars to unchain it, and Eris&rsquo;s story is such an example of this truth. For what force in nature had granted Eris, that 17-year-old girl, her remarkable ability to steal, unnoticed, as if she were invisible to the world?</p><p>What comes after is the stuff of legends, worlds awakening anew, blossoming like flowers in the springtide, and the unmasking of long buried truths. In time, the Vault unveiled a world rich with the secrets of the universe. All it took to uncover these secrets was to trust in the grace of nature and believe in a girl who steals in the shallow ends.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/robbery-and-heists/>Robbery and Heists</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-vault-robbery-secrets-of-the-ultimate-heist/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Vault Robbery: Secrets of the Ultimate Heist</span>
