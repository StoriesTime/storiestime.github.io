A young woman named Cadence might&rsquo;ve been an anomaly, yet she moved with purpose, her eyes giving away the secrets of a fleeting hope. Her accomplice, or perhaps prisoner, went by the enigmatic title of the Unburied Coil. Though never seen in human form, he projected a sense of self in the subtle and careful deliberate dance of ceaseless shadows. To most, the Unburied Coil was as elusive and evasive as a specter.</p><p>A Traitor&rsquo;s Second Chance</p><p>Cadence had been pardoned for her past infractions by the Divine High-Programmers— pardon being an odd term for betrayal. They had revealed to her the supreme truth, a covert operation named The Perfidious Loyalty, in which the Unburied Coil was to be her one and only charge. The High-Programmers were far removed from what in many dimensions were considered living beings. They came from the tangled strings of a realm without form or substance, intact at the very core of the creation and ultimate destroyer. This invisible power had whispered the ultimate test to Cadence: Be the binding bond between the Unburied Coil and the light of a new day.</p><p>Inherently Bound by Treason</p><p>The Sharpnel Skyscraper, in existence since the dawn of time itself, had stood silent witness to countless cycles of creation and destruction. Intricate mazes of darkness and light wound throughout its population of disoriented and unseeing souls. These exchanges were not entirely unwanted, and so the hidden floor where Cadence and the Unburied Coil found themselves entwined was the very arena where they would wage war against their true selves, those who&rsquo;d danced to the whims of the Sharpnel Skyscraper for more than the span of a thousand lifetimes.</p><p>Inside the Nine Crimson Tomes of the Unburied Coil</p><p>It was within the Nine Crimson Tomes—ancient texts of an unfathomable tongue—that the Unburied Coil drew his power. Sequestered relics of unclaimed memory that whispered to the chosen ones the allure of tantamount potential.</p><p>The Unburied Coil&rsquo;s shadow had been known to decry upon these tomes, seeking the answers to questions never asked. His markings of chaos were prized, revered as puzzles by those who could unsee themselves in the tomes&rsquo; many pages, revealing the hidden depths of long-lost knowledge.</p><p>Bound by Treason, Stepping into a New Age</p><p>Cadence was on a mission in the dimly lit labyrinth of the Skyscraper. Trusting her instincts, she led the Unburied Coil towards the distant and obscure source of light, Earthling by Earthling, room by room. To surrender to the darkness would be to succumb to their true enemies—the silent and discontent throng who still lurked in the cold stone expanse of the Skyscraper.</p><p>Guided by visions and fragmented dreams, Cadence steered the Unburied Coil toward the edges of thought. In the haze of perception, a new challenge presented itself: they had reached a dead end. Cadence stood, frozen in fear and the oppressive air thick with unspoken secrets. The Unburied Coil&rsquo;s trace of darkness pulled away from the Nine Crimson Tomes, collapsing around his partner.</p><p>In that single moment of consternation, the Unburied Coil—master of shadows—shifted to the tune of a melody that had danced in her bloodline for many generations. Cadence drew her weapon, swift of motion.</p><p>As a living spark gripped the doomsday device, the aged vents pulsed with vibrant energy, and the walls began to sing with melodies of olden days. Shadows Assembled, and the once sequestered tomes sought the light.</p><p>Bound by Treason, Together and Apart</p><p>Suddenly, the Skyscraper sighed in release. Colossal slabs loosened from their ancient moorings, the labyrinth came undone to reveal a magnificent palace in its place.</p><p>The Unburied Coil slumped down to rest while his dark dance of shadows continued to unwind. With each passing second, more of him appeared, breathing life into countless previously still-dimensional figures, inciting the warring factions of that strange and unsettling realm.</p><p>In the end, they both found themselves whole; the chosen of shadow and light.</p><p>Reality reconstructed as the light found its course to become one with the boundless expanse of the sky, leaving the shadow to reside in the labyrinth designed to reside within the Nine Crimson Tomes forevermore.</p><p>Gone, but not forgotten. The Unburied Coil held the leash of shadow, connected to the Skyscraper by tendrils of darkness. In the end, the two were bound by treason, each having their place in the ever-wavering cosmos.</p><p>The long night that once ruled over all has ended. The sun shines brighter than ever, as dawn breaks across time and space. The pen has mercy, let the ink dry.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/villains-and-antagonists/>Villains and Antagonists</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/beyond-the-villain-the-motives-that-shape-the-antagonist/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Beyond the Villain: The Motives That Shape the Antagonist</span>
