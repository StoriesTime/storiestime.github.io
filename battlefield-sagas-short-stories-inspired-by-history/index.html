The casualties of war were typically buried where they fell, but in a remote region north of the Danube River, something extraordinary happened. The Legion XX Valeria Victrix was lost without a trace, and nobody knows what happened to them.</p><h2 id=the-legions-journey>The Legion&rsquo;s Journey</h2><p>Led by Commander Decimus Gallus, the Legion XX Valeria Victrix was marching north from their winter quarters in Vindobala (modern-day Vienna) in the province of Pannonia. The journey&rsquo;s goal was to receive the surrender of local tribes that had not yet submitted to Roman rule along the Danube frontier. The commander&rsquo;s plan was to use a swift and deadly surprise attack to achieve victory.</p><h2 id=the-mysterious-evacuation>The Mysterious Evacuation</h2><p>One day, the column was traversing dense and mysterious forest, and their scouts, who had ventured ahead, did not return. Gallus decided to press on and ordered the troops to keep a cautious watch. However, it was too late. A dense fog covered the plain and engulfed the entire column, leaving them as helpless as fish out of water. The troops could not tell friend from foe, nor even discern the positions of their own comrades. Incidentally, the legion became disoriented in the foggy labyrinth. The Legion XX Valeria Victrix vanished.</p><h2 id=decimus-gallus-final-decision>Decimus Gallus&rsquo; Final Decision</h2><p>Fearing the worst for their comrades, Decimus Gallus made the difficult choice to divide the unit, hoping that part of the legion might escape the foggy trap. Under the cover of darkness, he led a small group of survivors to Wels, about 20 kilometers east of the modern Linz, hoping that the fog would soon dissipate so they could reassemble their forces and return to the border.</p><h2 id=a-mysterious-protector>A Mysterious Protector</h2><p>The fog seemed to have a life of its own, as it clung to the ground for three days and three nights, providing no sign of clearing. Strangely enough, a priestess of Dobunnic origin, Bottafaqua, had appeared to provide nourishment for the lost legionaries. She had been drugged by the fog, saved from her village by the Roman soldiers, and seemed to be entranced by the mist. However, she whispered something unusual to Decimus Gallus: &ldquo;When you feel the fog lift, you&rsquo;ll know where to look for the rest of the XX Valeria Victrix.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=the-insights-of-the-priestess>The Insights of the Priestess</h2><p>The only hope seemed to lie with this mysterious priestess, so Gallus decided to heed her guidance. Bottafaqua pointed to the west and indicating that the fog would soon lift in that direction. Then, she claimed she saw the soldiers&rsquo; final resting place. &ldquo;I see a vast and hollow place where the legion must march. An abandoned and desolate city awaits your people.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=a-much-greater-loss>A Much Greater Loss</h2><p>The legion continued on the path, guided by the priestess&rsquo; words. Eventually, they found a windswept and desolate valley, devoid of life – a testament to the fog&rsquo;s murderous power. In the valley, the fog had taken a toll that the troops could never have imagined.</p><p>Close to the valley floor, clustered around a single gradual burial mound, they discovered a horrific sight. A mass grave, overfilled with Roman soldiers and both friend and foe from the legion and local tribes encased in a hardened, ice-like embrace as if the fog had been determined to seal this as its final monument.</p><p>Bottafaqua fell silent to this harrowing sight. Decimus Gallus looked longingly down at the icy, numbed soldiers lying side by side in the rank lines, but he could not help thinking that she might have been forceful in her guidance.</p><h2 id=the-search-continues>The Search Continues</h2><p>The lamentable news reached Rome in the summer of 72 AD. As the fog gave way, the Roman Empire found that the loss among the legions exceeded 2,000 men. It became evident that the fog remained an enigma, unsolved by the great empire&rsquo;s power, methods, or might.</p><p>This haunting tale remains part of the Battle of the Danube&rsquo;s mystique, marking a somber path in the history of the Roman Empire. To this day, the memory of the Legion XX Valeria Victrix lingers in the hills, valleys, and forests of central Europe, where the horrors of war and nature&rsquo;s wrath collided. Somewhere, still marking its eternal passage, the heavy and mournful embrace of the mist continues to seek another lost, whispered soul. This is the story of The Lost Legion.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/famous-battles/>Famous Battles</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/battlefield-legends-the-most-famous-wars-and-their-stories/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Battlefield Legends: The Most Famous Wars and Their Stories</span>
