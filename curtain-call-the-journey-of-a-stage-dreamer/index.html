As the stage manager's assistant, she was responsible for ensuring that the show went smoothly, but something was missing for her. At night, in her small bedroom above the alleyway behind the theater, she would lie on her bed staring at the painted ceiling, fantasizing about herself on stage. She dreamed of being the shining star, center stage, pouring her heart out to the audiences.
Emma started taking acting lessons on the sly, sneaking away from rehearsals to walk to the quaint little studio theater on the side of town, where she received her training and honed her craft. Despite her passion growing stronger with every passing day, she couldn't shake the fact that she worked behind the curtain, watching, waiting, helping others shine rather than herself being the one she wanted to observe.
One quiet evening, at the end of a particularly slow rehearsal, when the rest of the crew slipped out to find dinner, her stage manager cornered her behind the wings as the lights illuminated the empty floor. "Emily, I sense you're at a crossroad," he warned, his thick, New Jersey accent dripping warm concern. Her eyes dropped when he said what she already secretly knew:
"You're dreaming of being right there, among the actors themselves, aren't you?" Taking a deep, calming breath of the musty air, with the faint fragrance of paint hovering above, like a ghost holding its breath - she nodded yes. "Because, sweetheart? That's different. That needs courage, confidence, and self-doubts left behind as you step past the curtain; the real performers' line awaits."
Emma began to realize something profound. Why was she feeling this way only now? Behind the scenes worked for her previous roles, with her previous job, but no longer. Since the day at the studio learning the craft by herself, behind the scenes turned into a limbo, always a step far from the moment she truly enjoyed. The spark within her wouldn't be reignited until there was a spot for her amongst the performers of the stage as well.
Two weeks later her manager, finally, offered Emily a chance; a small community theater production at the edge of town. Excited, despite the butterflies starting to flutter away in her ribcage because of the change, she seized the opportunity knowing that it gave her the nudge she genuinely needed. During the first morning of rehearsals, Emma didn't know when she would know she was among the right characters, but on the first real performance night; the lights danced around her very presence, embracing her as herself, a dancer, a moving figure on top of the spotlights. Emily's eyes held a sparkle tonight, her emotions were on pure fire, on stage.
Here, in fact, was 'Curtain Call', to her, nothing more than "the moment just before the exit, when nothing else matters for the audience that's been listening to the main character's whole story." Behind the scenes the world was black and white still, but today, on those lights, even the colors shimmered with what she felt deeply inside. Behind the curtain became the threshold over which she transcended, reaching the world ahead, a light shining brighter among the rest after the moment has passed.
"You're shining; your moment truly is here as well," reminded her manager by her side behind the wings long after the scene had ended while the curtains would close. What she felt while the curtains started to close? The moment between the final fall of the shades and the night's end signaled a new way of life dawning. Backstage was to be her step, her true place. Curtain call, what a journey into the unknown light, she went on to illuminate.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/music-and-performing-arts/>Music and Performing Arts</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/curtain-call-the-final-performance-that-changed-everything/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Curtain Call: The Final Performance That Changed Everything</span>
