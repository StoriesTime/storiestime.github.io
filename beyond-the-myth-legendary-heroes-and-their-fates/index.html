Atop the craggy bastion of old Myriadis, the tattered banners of a forgotten age stuttered in the air. This was a night reserved for legends—half-remembered, half-feared, and barely believed. Here, in the shell of a broken fortress, the survivors of deeds greater than themselves had gathered. They called themselves the Bereft.</p><p>Tirian of the Northlands, sword-saint and bane of Pale Kings, stood atop the parapet. His cloak, once royal blue, was darkened by years and dust. He still bore his father’s sword, Heartcleaver; its hilt gold and sapphires, blade etched with so many memories that every swipe shimmered with the ghosts of battles past.</p><p>A voice rose from below—a wry, familiar lilt, more quill than steel. “You always find the highest spot, Tirian. Hoping to catch some lost starlight?”</p><p>Tirian turned. Elaenor the Clever, flame of Eredain, leaned on her staff, hair wild as heather in bloom. Her crippled leg barely slowed her defiant gait. She&rsquo;d once slipped through the claws of gods and the machinations of men, her mind sharper than any blade at Myriadis.</p><p>“Just thinking, Elaenor. The stars aren’t what they were,” he replied, more weary than aloof.</p><p>“They seldom are, when you stand this close to the world’s end,” Elaenor said, brushing aside the cold with a practiced shrug. “You brood much, old friend.”</p><p>He gave a rueful smile. “Brooding is for the young. I mourn what cannot be reclaimed.”</p><p>Far below them, what remained of the Bereft kindled a fire. There were seven now: Tirian; Elaenor; Ser Korrick, the exile whose fists had split mountains; Mara, mistress of shadows; Ulien, once song-bearer to the Luminous Court; Efron, the giantslayer who wore his loneliness like a mantle; and fragile, haunted Ilian, last oracle of Vashel.</p><p>Mara flitted through the shadows, untraceable but for the gentle echo of her laugh. She approached the group seated round the fire, eyes bright, ever watchful. “We’ve grown fewer.”</p><p>“It is the way of legends,” said Ulien, drawing his lute with ancient hands. “We were made to fade, not to remain.”</p><p>His song filled the ruins—notes spun of sorrow and triumph, winding up to the stars. They all listened, for there was naught else to dispel the night’s dread.</p><p>Then, as the flames guttered in the wind, Efron spoke in his booming, careful way. “Long have we lived in tales. But who knows our truths?” He looked around, eyes longing for understanding. “Not the minstrels nor the priests. Not even the children dreaming under their covers.”</p><p>Ilian’s voice, thin as parchment, barely carried. “Then let us speak our truths. Let ours be the myth that births honesty, not glory.”</p><p>Tirian glanced at the stars, then at those whose names might outlive memory, and nodded. “It is time.”</p><p>And so, round the crumbled fire, they spun their stories: unvarnished, unheroic, lived.</p><h3 id=tirianthe-lions-shadow>Tirian—The Lion’s Shadow</h3><p>They called him the Lion of the North, the man who shattered the siege of Grayhold with a single charge. But Tirian remembered trembling under the weight of the enemy, his sword arm numb, slaughter issuing from him not as valor but terror. The corpse piles haunted his sleep; the people&rsquo;s cheers rang hollow as bells in his ears. Each legend told of his triumph, not the cold that crept into his bones, nor the shapes of friends he’d stepped over to reach the sanctuary of victory.</p><p>He emptied his cup, and silence consumed the revelation.</p><h3 id=elaenorwit-as-weapon>Elaenor—Wit as Weapon</h3><p>Elaenor’s story was a dance through court intrigue. The tale the world heard: how she out-thought the tyrant Varkos with a puzzle box impossible to open. The reality: a desperate bargain with a serpent, and sleepless nights, and lives bartered for a country saved, yet never truly safe. Her wit had drawn a loyal shadow of spies, but left her walking solitary through corridors filled with fear.</p><p>Her laughter died in her throat as she spoke, but grew truer for it.</p><h3 id=ser-korrickthe-iron-fist>Ser Korrick—The Iron Fist</h3><p>They called Ser Korrick living stone, too hard for breaking. He’d hoisted drowned horses from rivers, cracked boulders with bare hands, dueled the ogre lords of Rimrock and lived. Yet none remembered his sister, the one he failed to save from fever despite his strength; the years afterward bent on tasks unwinnable, hoping to trade might for meaning. Muscles atrophied but his sorrow never did.</p><p>He clenched his fist and unclenched it, the mountain in him softened by memory.</p><h3 id=maraghost-between-worlds>Mara—Ghost Between Worlds</h3><p>Once, Mara had been mentioned in fearful whispers—an assassin so silent that her marks only realized their doom when the light left their eyes. To those with power, she was a night breeze, a knife in the dark. But greatness in shadows breeds only deeper darkness; every life she took grew heavier. Her finest work, she admitted, was escaping the web of debt and murder before it consumed her soul, though freedom cost her every friend.</p><p>Her eyes flickered like the fire, moving ceaselessly, remembering and trying to forget.</p><h3 id=ulienthe-song-bearer>Ulien—The Song-Bearer</h3><p>Ulien, bard of the Luminous Court, had crafted songs that ignited rebellions and cooled wars. Lovers met by his verses, and enemies were silenced by the pain he wove into music. Yet as he grew old, the magic waned, and he saw how song could not heal broken bodies nor mend every wound. His truth was softer, sadder—music could give hope, not salvation.</p><p>He strummed his lute, a melody untarnished by time, and smiled into the dying flames.</p><h3 id=efronslayer-of-giants>Efron—Slayer of Giants</h3><p>Efron’s legend was bloody: the day he snapped the neck of the giant Tarben in single combat, saving the valley. High walls were built atop the giant’s corpse, his trophy bones paraded in every town. But the truth? He killed not of heroism, but of desperation—his village’s fields destroyed and children starving. Tarben’s last look haunted him: a golem bewildered as a child, dying for the sin of being different.</p><p>His shoulders sagged beneath invisible burdens, heavier than an ogre’s skull.</p><h3 id=ilianlast-oracle>Ilian—Last Oracle</h3><p>Ilian was said to see fate itself, to channel prophecy so pure rulers knelt for her word. Yet her visions were more curse than gift, riddles wrapped in fire and ice. Every prophecy delivered cost her pieces of herself; she saw not just glory ahead but groaning loss, not just kings’ triumphs but generations of suffering. Even now, with her audience diminished to these broken few, she could sense their fates winding down to some silent conclusion.</p><p>Her eyes, blind but unclouded, gazed at each of them in turn.</p><hr><p>At dawn, the Bereft scattered the ashes of their last shared fire. They’d confessed their sins and allowed one another’s wounds to breathe. The world would remember their legends as bright, shining lies. But they, the mortal souls beneath myths, found solace in frailty.</p><p>Tirian lingered as the others drifted away, last to leave the ruins of Myriadis. Elaenor limped beside him, her arm looped in his.</p><p>“We pass from legend into dust,” she said, quiet as the waking breeze.</p><p>“Let them speak our stories,” Tirian replied. “Let them make gods of men. We loved, we lost. We did what seemed right, or what we could bear.”</p><p>Elaenor snorted. “Heroism is for the dead. The living must endure.”</p><p>The ancient fortress looked out over wilderlands gone green and gold in the sun. Somewhere beyond the horizon, new legends walked, oblivious to the pain and doubt that would one day dog their names. The old heroes gave the world their silence. Let those who followed learn the truth in their own time.</p><p>They descended the hill, companions at last, no longer icons but friends whose stories had finally been told—not for glory, but for the relief of honesty. The wind, having stripped the banners, let the ruins sleep.</p><p>The myth endured, but its dungeon had been unlocked. Underneath the weight of story, human hearts still beat—the final, secret triumph.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/mythology-and-legends/>Mythology and Legends</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/beneath-the-mountain-the-legend-of-the-dwarf-king/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Beneath the Mountain: The Legend of the Dwarf King</span>
