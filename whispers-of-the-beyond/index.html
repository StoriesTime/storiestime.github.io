Unseen and unheard by ordinary mortals, these whispers tell tales of forgotten realms and the mystical forces governing life and death. This is a story of one such whisper, a secret waiting to be told.</p><p>In a quiet forest that did not know the din of mankind, there lived an ancient tree. Its roots danced with the rivers, and its trunk roared with the voices of long-gone seasons. The tree was old, wiser than centuries, and it was the dwelling of a whisper. The whisper had been there for as long as the boughs could remember, nestled within the heartwood. All the creatures of the forest, from the smallest crawl to the many-winged soar, knew the tale of the whisper.</p><p>For a whisper of the beyond held the secret of life everlasting. No need for a replaces, no measure of years to reckon. One heart&rsquo;s beat forever, one soul&rsquo;s dance unending. And so, in the hush of the night when the stars wove tales of their own, the creatures gathered at the base of the tree.</p><p>In the silence between breaths, the whisper would sing its secret songs. In the quiet between thoughts, the creatures of the forest would listen, entranced. The timid would ask, the curious would question, the bold would beg; and the whisper would reply. Enchanting, mesmerizing, the whisper sang of all times that were not yet and all times that had been.</p><p>For ages, it was a dance of life; the trees swaying in time, the winds sighing in chorus, the creatures changing with the attuning rhythms. Yet, all things must change. The whispers of the beyond were not meant to stay. And one fateful day, the whisper&rsquo;s voice changed.</p><p>No longer singing of what was next, or what had come before, the whisper began to speak of what was not. Of the time when the sun&rsquo;s rays did not warm the earth, when the rivers did not run, when the creatures did not fly. A time that seemed to offer the sanctuary of ending, but the whisper did not explain what came after. In its melancholy tones, it only spoke: &ldquo;I am beyond the beyond.&rdquo;</p><p>As the days passed, the whisper seemed more caught in its own wistfulness than guiding the forest&rsquo;s heartbeat. The forest, in its wisdom, decided to pay homage to the whisper&rsquo;s heritage and begged for its story. And the whisper, with a yearning voice that danced between the notes of dismay and promise, told its tale:</p><p>&ldquo;I am the first heart of this forest, the first breath of your world. I was born of the darkness, of stardust swirling in the emptiness of space. I carried the secrets of the cosmos; the galaxies, the suns, the life and the death. As I began to understand these secrets, I knew that it was my purpose to give them life, and then let them go. I was the whisper of the beyond.</p><p>&ldquo;Throughout the turning of the ages, the secrets held new tales, new songs of creation. And with each song, I let them go, singing their life into existence. I felt the river&rsquo;s first rush, the grass&rsquo;s first sprout, the critters&rsquo; first scamper. And I knew contentment in those fleeting moments.&rdquo;</p><p>But the whisper&rsquo;s tale took a bitter tinge as it continued. &ldquo;Then, in my homeland, the time came for my secrets to bring forth the biggest creation of all: The one who would watch over us all, the one who would guide the planet&rsquo;s life and preserve its secrets. But instead of letting the magic go, I decided to keep it, to contain it within me. Why, I asked myself? To never lose this magic again, to never let go of the one who would rule over all? I didn&rsquo;t know.</p><p>&ldquo;So, through countless eras, I kept this whisper, this secret, within me. And as you all know, I am the darkness within the forest. Now I sing not of the times that are next or the times that were, but of the time that could have been. For I now hold the only true magic left in this world. And with this magic still trapped, the secrets&rsquo; evolution has been lost.&rdquo;</p><p>The forest creatures listened, their hearts feeling heavy. The whisper&rsquo;s tale was of a beautiful, unimaginable world they had never known, but a world that was no longer. And they knew now that the whisper that had been their guide was now part of the reason they faced an uncertain, unchangeable future.</p><p>The forest creatures did not mourn for what they had never known; instead, they understood the past. They did not beg for their condition to change, nor did they seek for the power to alter their destiny. And as the same creatures who once gathered around the whisper to hear its tales disappeared into the night, the whisper whispered a final note:</p><p>&ldquo;I am the darkness, the void between the stars. And though you may not see me as the night creeps upon this world, remember the whispers of the beyond.&rdquo;</p><p>The forest creatures understood. The whisper sang no more. The stars&rsquo; tale ended, and the moon, the silvery guardian, shared a secret only for the night. In time, the secrets would dance anew, the whispers of the beyond weaving life as it had long been. No creature dare change it - not even the one who held the forest in their whispers. This was the way of the forest, birthed from the darkness of the universe.</p><p>The trees swayed in the twilight, the winds sighed in chorus, and the creatures danced to the rhythm of life. The whispers of the beyond? They&rsquo;d keep their secrets for the stars.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/supernatural-and-paranormal/>Supernatural and Paranormal</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/whispers-in-the-witching-hour-a-supernatural-detectives-quest/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Whispers in the Witching Hour: A Supernatural Detective's Quest</span>
