Maxime walked its path every night after his shift at the patisserie, uniform dusted with flour, hands stinging from sugar burns. Some nights he caught himself glimpsing through café windows, watching couples clutching hands across sticky tables, imagining what it might feel like to taste love, even if only once.</p><p>He’d known Camille since university—those blue velvet lecture halls that smelled of espresso and anticipation. Her laugh had carried like bells through the crowded amphitheatre, her notebooks scrawled full of poetry, classmates’ secrets, and grocery lists side by side. They were friends in the way that seemed effortless: drifting into the same circle, talking long after group meetings were over, sharing pastries in abandoned courtyards or cheap wine by the riverside.</p><p>There were moments—small, bright things—when Maxime thought something more could unfurl between them. A night when the rain chased them beneath a narrow archway, close enough to hear her breath; a morning tangled in laughter, hungover from cheap Beaujolais. But always one of them would flinch away first. Something, perhaps fear or the myth of timing, stacked invisible walls between their conversations.</p><p>After graduation, life’s current tugged them toward different banks. He stayed in Lyon, folding pastries at dawn, honing a craft in the kitchen’s hush; she drifted to Berlin on a scholarship, sending him postcards with German idioms and sketches of Turkish markets. Messages came and went, sometimes weeks apart, until communication became a slow drift—occasional updates, memories like old photographs, faded but persistent.</p><p>Three years passed.</p><h3 id=the-letter>The Letter</h3><p>It was late March when Maxime’s landlady pressed a letter into his hand, her silver braid coiled like a cat around her shoulders. “From abroad,” she winked, and disappeared behind a door that creaked with secrets.</p><p>Inside was a plane ticket, the corners soft with handling. One line written on the back in Camille’s slanting hand:</p><p><em>Come see me. The lilacs are almost blooming, and they remind me of us.</em></p><p>He read the words until they blurred. That night, awake in his attic room, Maxime debated taking the chance. Habit and hesitation wrestled in the darkness—he had a job, a life here, and she might just mean to catch up as friends. But the ache of possibility, grown calcified over the years, gnawed at him.</p><p>He called in a favor, traded shifts with Luc, and the next morning he was on his way to Berlin, the countryside unfurling outside his window in ribbons of green and gold.</p><h3 id=berlin>Berlin</h3><p>The city was a jangle of languages and streetcars, wild with graffiti and the scent of street food. Camille lived above a violin shop, her apartment cluttered with canvases, potted herbs, and threadbare rugs. She was thinner than he remembered, her hair cropped impatiently short, but her eyes sparkled with the same mischievous light.</p><p>They talked for hours by her kitchen window overlooking the courtyard, the sky turning to pearl. She poured him thick Turkish coffee, dusted with cardamom, and told him stories of her students, her paintings, the accidental fox that slept in their communal garden.</p><p>For the first day, laughter papered over expectations. Old jokes, memories revived, companions walking a city that neither truly belonged to, yet both remembered through the other’s eyes.</p><p>That evening, they wandered into Prenzlauer Berg, the lilacs beginning to shiver with color. On a park bench, Camille pressed her feet into the sand, her face gone tentative. “Maxime… do you ever wonder what might have happened if one of us said something, back then?”</p><p>He swallowed. “Every day.”</p><p>A train rattled by, espresso-bright and vanishing. Camille’s hand hovered above his, and for a moment, hope unfurled in his chest like a new season.</p><p>But the moment passed. A friend from her art collective whirled by—loud, effusive, dragging Camille into a hug. When introductions faded, the magic of confession dissolved. The rest of the evening was laughter and wine and new acquaintances, the would-have-been moment sliding away like a pebble underwater.</p><h3 id=missed-signals>Missed Signals</h3><p>Over the week, they threaded through the city’s spring—picnics in the Tiergarten, frantic cycling through Kreuzberg, dim-lit jazz clubs where Maxime watched Camille sketch on a napkin, head bent in concentration.</p><p>Late one night, lost on the U-Bahn, she rested her head on his shoulder. Lines blurred; the city softened. Maxime tried to memorize the warmth, but words stuck behind his teeth. Each opportunity to confess slipped by—a pause too long, a joke to bury the longing, his self-doubt filling the gaps.</p><p>In the tented markets of Maybachufer, as they shared ripe strawberries, Camille glanced up, cheeks stained. “I think about Lyon all the time. About those nights on the river.”</p><p>He smiled. “Me too.”</p><p>She closed her eyes for a heartbeat. “I wish I’d been braver.”</p><p>He wanted to reach for her, tell her that timing was a trick and that love didn’t need perfect moments. But then a vendor called out, the currents of the world demanding their attention. They drifted onward without another word on the subject.</p><p>Three days later, Maxime returned to Lyon. They hugged at the station—long, trembling, but without promise.</p><h3 id=afterwards>Afterwards</h3><p>Back home, Maxime returned to the patisserie. Life resumed its gentle monotony: sourdough rising in early morning shadows, locals arguing over pastries, tourists mangling the French names for éclairs. The city felt smaller, somehow, its corners hollowed out by the memory of what almost was.</p><p>They wrote less. Greetings for birthdays, the occasional painting or photo sent as a digital olive branch. He kept the plane ticket tucked in a drawer, the letters faded but still sharp with the scent of cardamom.</p><p>Years spooled by.</p><p>Maxime met someone else eventually—Marie, a shy museum curator with a soft spot for Monet and stray cats. She was kind, patient; their affection settled not as wildfire, but as gentle rainfall. They built a life of routines—weekend markets, languid Sunday brunches, picnics by the Arna—and for a long time, he was content. But sometimes, in the blue hush before dawn, Camille’s laughter echoed faintly, a secret stitched into the shadowed corners of his heart.</p><h3 id=full-circles>Full Circles</h3><p>Ten years on, Maxime visited Berlin with Marie and their daughter. The city had changed—gentrified, reshaped—but the violin shop still stood, faded and stubborn.</p><p>He walked by, pausing just long enough to press his palm to the old wooden door. Down the street, the lilacs bloomed, fierce and defiant.</p><p>He wondered if Camille still lived nearby, if she passed the courtyard, if she remembered that week when their lives almost changed.</p><p>Love, he realized, was rarely about perfect timing or cinematic conclusions. Sometimes it was about the nearly, the almost. The ache left by unspoken possibilities. And sometimes, that tenderness lasted longer, endured more stubbornly, than even the grandest of realized romances.</p><pre tabindex=0><code>
On the way home, Maxime watched the sun set over the Arna, colors bleeding into each other, impossible to separate—so like memory, so like longing. And as the water shivered pink under the bridge, he thought of all the lives they’d lived in parallel, lives that brushed close but never quite overlapped.

He reached for Marie’s hand. Their daughter laughed, chasing pigeons in a flurry of feather and shriek.

Behind them, the lilacs dreamed on.

And mixed with the sweetness of the present, Maxime carried, quietly and always, the love that almost was.
