The town of Eldridge was one such place. Nestled deep within the misty hills, Eldridge had long been forgotten by most. Its roads, cobbled and uneven, twisted through a landscape that had been left untouched by modern hands. Amid the forgotten town stood the Eldridge Manor, a vast, crumbling estate once inhabited by the wealthy and influential Langley family.</p><p>But that was before.</p><p>Before the fire. Before the tragedy. Before the ghosts of the forgotten began to haunt its halls.</p><p>Rumors had surrounded the manor for decades. Whispers of strange occurrences and eerie figures seen through its decaying windows had spread like wildfire. Some claimed that the Langley family was cursed, while others believed they had angered an ancient force during their time at the manor. Whatever the truth, the manor had become a symbol of dread for the people of Eldridge, a place that everyone avoided.</p><p>Yet, despite the ominous reputation, there were those who couldn&rsquo;t resist the call. The thrill-seekers, the skeptics, and the curious had all ventured into the manor at one time or another, only to return with pale faces and trembling hands, unable to explain what they had experienced.</p><p>It was on one such dreary evening that a group of adventurers—four friends with a shared passion for uncovering the supernatural—arrived in Eldridge. They had heard the stories, of course. But they were convinced they were nothing more than local folklore, exaggerated by time and fear.</p><p>Lena, the leader of the group, was the first to speak as they stood before the manor&rsquo;s imposing gates. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve come this far. Let&rsquo;s see if there&rsquo;s really something to all these stories.&rdquo;</p><p>Her voice was steady, but her hands were cold as she gripped the iron bars. The others exchanged uneasy glances before nodding in agreement.</p><p>Caleb, the skeptic of the group, snorted. &ldquo;Ghosts, curses, and haunted houses. It&rsquo;s all nonsense. We’re just here to film and get some content for the channel.&rdquo;</p><p>Lena shot him a knowing look. &ldquo;Just remember, Caleb, you said the same thing about that abandoned asylum last month, and look what happened.&rdquo;</p><p>He muttered under his breath, but said nothing more. The group pushed open the creaking gates and walked down the overgrown path that led to the manor.</p><p>The air grew colder the closer they got. The wind seemed to pick up, swirling around them as if it had a mind of its own. The once-grand staircase leading up to the entrance was covered in thick vines, but they climbed it, one step at a time, their footsteps echoing in the stillness.</p><p>As they crossed the threshold into the manor, the door slammed shut behind them with a resounding bang. Caleb cursed under his breath, while the others froze in place.</p><p>&ldquo;That wasn’t me,&rdquo; said Emily, the youngest of the group, her voice shaky. She had always been the most sensitive to strange energy, the one who could sense things others couldn’t. And right now, her instincts were screaming at her to leave.</p><p>Lena, however, remained undeterred. &ldquo;It was the wind. Let’s keep going.&rdquo;</p><p>The foyer of the manor was vast, its marble floors cracked and worn from years of neglect. Chandeliers hung from the ceiling, covered in dust, their once-glimmering crystals now dulled by time. The walls were adorned with faded portraits of long-forgotten ancestors, their eyes following the group as they moved deeper into the manor.</p><p>&ldquo;I’ll start setting up the cameras,&rdquo; Caleb said, pulling out his equipment. He was trying to maintain his bravado, but the hairs on the back of his neck stood up as if they were being watched.</p><p>The group split up, each taking a different wing of the manor to explore. As Lena wandered through the dark hallways, her flashlight flickered erratically, casting long, shifting shadows that seemed to have a life of their own. She shuddered but pressed on, determined to prove that there was nothing to fear.</p><p>But then she heard it.</p><p>A soft whisper. So faint that she almost thought she had imagined it. She stopped, listening intently, but the sound didn’t come again.</p><p>&ldquo;Just the wind,&rdquo; she muttered to herself. But even as she spoke, the air grew heavier, colder. It felt as though something was right behind her, breathing down her neck.</p><p>Suddenly, the door at the end of the hallway creaked open by itself.</p><p>Lena&rsquo;s heart skipped a beat, but curiosity outweighed her fear. She cautiously approached the door, her flashlight trembling in her hand. The room beyond was shrouded in darkness, the walls lined with shelves full of old, dust-covered books.</p><p>At the far end of the room stood an old wooden chair, its back turned toward her. The hairs on her arms stood up as she stepped closer. Something about the chair felt&mldr; wrong.</p><p>A sudden gust of wind slammed the door shut behind her, and the chair spun around, its occupant revealing itself in the dim light.</p><p>A figure. A woman, dressed in tattered black clothes, her face pale and gaunt. Her eyes were wide, hollow, and filled with an endless sadness. She didn’t speak. She didn’t move.</p><p>Lena stumbled back, her breath catching in her throat.</p><p>&ldquo;Did anyone else hear that?&rdquo; she whispered, her voice trembling as she turned to flee. But as she reached the door, it slammed shut again with a force that rattled the walls.</p><p>In the other wing of the manor, Caleb and Emily had also encountered something far beyond their expectations. Caleb had been setting up a camera in what appeared to be an old study when he heard a faint scratching sound. He glanced around, trying to locate the source, but found nothing.</p><p>&ldquo;You hear that?&rdquo; Emily asked, her face pale as she looked at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. It’s probably a rat or something,&rdquo; Caleb said, though he didn’t believe his own words.</p><p>The scratching grew louder, more frantic, and then, to their horror, they noticed the door at the far end of the room slowly creaking open. A cold draft swept through the study, and the air thickened with the oppressive feeling of something unseen, something ancient, stirring in the dark.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, this is getting weird,&rdquo; Caleb muttered. &ldquo;Let’s just finish up and get out of here.&rdquo;</p><p>But before they could move, the room grew dark. The windows slammed shut, trapping them in utter darkness. A low growl, distant yet unmistakable, echoed through the air, and the shadows around them seemed to twist and writhe.</p><p>Emily screamed, and Caleb’s hand shot out, grabbing her arm. &ldquo;We need to leave. Now.&rdquo;</p><p>But it was too late.</p><p>The door slammed open with a deafening crash, revealing a figure in the doorway. It was tall, its body covered in a dark cloak, its face obscured by shadows. It moved towards them with unnatural speed, its footsteps silent on the wooden floor.</p><p>The figure raised a hand, and the temperature in the room plummeted. Their breath came out in visible puffs of cold air, and the sound of the growl grew louder, filling their ears.</p><p>Emily let out another scream, and as if in response, the figure vanished into the darkness, leaving only a trail of cold air behind.</p><p>&ldquo;Run!&rdquo; Caleb shouted, dragging Emily toward the door.</p><p>They burst into the main hall, breathless and panicked, but when they turned to look for Lena, they found the manor eerily silent.</p><p>The entire group reunited in the foyer, their faces pale and eyes wide with terror. They had all felt it now—the presence, the ancient energy that haunted Eldridge Manor. The spirits of the forgotten were no longer whispers in the dark. They were real.</p><p>Lena took a step toward the door, but it wouldn&rsquo;t budge. The entire manor seemed to be alive, groaning and creaking as if it were holding them prisoner.</p><p>&ldquo;Why aren’t we leaving?&rdquo; Emily whimpered.</p><p>&ldquo;It won’t let us,&rdquo; Lena said, her voice barely above a whisper. &ldquo;We’re not supposed to leave. Not yet.&rdquo;</p><p>And in that moment, they understood the truth about the manor. It wasn’t just haunted—it was a prison. A place where the ghosts of the forgotten waited, forever trapped in the cycle of their own suffering, their own regrets. And now, the group had become part of that cycle.</p><p>The last thing they saw before the manor swallowed them whole was the face of the woman in black, her hollow eyes staring back at them, as if to say, &ldquo;Welcome home.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=chapter-two-the-unseen>Chapter Two: The Unseen</h3><p>To be continued&mldr;</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/ghost-stories/>Ghost Stories</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/ghosts-of-the-forgotten-creepy-urban-legends/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Ghosts of the Forgotten: Creepy Urban Legends</span>
