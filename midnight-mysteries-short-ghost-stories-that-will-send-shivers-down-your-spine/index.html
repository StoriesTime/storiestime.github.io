The house was a dark silhouette against the moonlit sky, its windows staring blankly like vacant eyes. The neighbors had warned her about the place, but Sarah was used to dismissing such things. After all, she was a practical woman, a woman of logic and reason. But something about the house felt different. It wasn’t just the creaky floors or the musty smell of dust and decay; it was the air itself—heavy, as if it were holding its breath.</p><p>The first night was uneventful. Sarah had unpacked, made a cup of tea, and gone to bed early, exhausted from the long drive. But as the clock struck midnight, she awoke with a start. There was a soft sound—like the whisper of fabric brushing against wood. She listened intently. It was coming from the hallway.</p><p>She sat up in bed, heart pounding in her chest. There was no one else in the house. She had checked every room before she turned in. Her mind raced, searching for a logical explanation, but none came. The house was old. It settled. That was all. Surely, that’s what it was.</p><p>But then she heard it again. A voice. Barely a whisper, but distinct enough to make her blood run cold.</p><p>“Sarah…”</p><p>It was her name. She could have sworn it was.</p><p>She froze. Her throat tightened. The voice was faint but unmistakable, like it was calling to her from the darkness, from beyond the walls. Trembling, she swung her legs over the side of the bed and slowly crept toward the door.</p><p>The hallway was pitch black. The moonlight didn’t reach this far into the house, and Sarah had no intention of turning on the lights. She didn’t want to wake whatever was hiding in the shadows. But her curiosity gnawed at her, and before she could stop herself, she was tiptoeing down the corridor, her breath shallow in her chest.</p><p>As she passed the old mirror at the end of the hall, something caught her eye—a flicker of movement in the glass. She spun around, but there was nothing there. Her pulse hammered in her ears.</p><p>It was the old house playing tricks on her, she told herself. But her rational mind couldn’t quiet the unease that settled deep in her stomach. As she turned back toward the door at the end of the hall, the voice spoke again—closer now.</p><p>“Sarah… come closer…”</p><p>A chill swept over her as if the temperature had dropped several degrees in an instant. She stood frozen in place. Her instincts screamed at her to turn around and run, but her feet wouldn’t move.</p><p>Suddenly, the door at the end of the hallway creaked open by itself.</p><p>The voice spoke once more, and this time it was clearer, sharper.</p><p>“Enter.”</p><hr><h2 id=the-woman-in-the-mirror>The Woman in the Mirror</h2><p>Sarah’s hand trembled as she reached for the doorknob. It was ice cold, sending a jolt of electricity up her spine. She hesitated for a moment, wondering if she should turn back. But her curiosity overpowered her fear. She had to know what was behind that door.</p><p>The door opened with an eerie squeal, revealing a dimly lit room. It was furnished simply, with a large four-poster bed draped in faded curtains. But what caught her attention was the full-length mirror on the far wall, standing tall and proud like a silent sentinel.</p><p>As Sarah stepped into the room, she felt a strange pull toward the mirror. She couldn’t explain it—something about it felt off, like it wasn’t just a reflection of the room, but something else entirely. Something that didn’t belong.</p><p>She walked closer, the sound of her footsteps muffled by the thick carpet. The reflection in the mirror didn’t look quite right. The angles were wrong, the lighting strange, as though the mirror were showing a different version of reality.</p><p>And then she saw her.</p><p>A woman. Standing in the corner of the room, just out of sight. Her back was turned, but Sarah could see the long, dark hair cascading down her shoulders. The woman was dressed in a flowing white gown, her posture stiff and unnatural. Her face was pale, and though she seemed to be looking directly at Sarah through the reflection, her eyes were hollow—empty voids, as if there was nothing behind them.</p><p>Sarah’s breath caught in her throat. She wanted to scream, to run, but her legs wouldn’t obey. Instead, she reached out toward the mirror, drawn by an invisible force. As her fingers brushed the cold glass, the image in the reflection began to distort. The woman’s face twisted into a grotesque mask, her mouth opening in a silent scream.</p><p>Before Sarah could pull away, the mirror seemed to shimmer and warp, as though it were a portal to another world.</p><p>Suddenly, the woman’s hand shot forward, her fingers pressing against the glass from the other side. The reflection’s hand slammed against Sarah’s, sending a sharp jolt of fear through her body. In that moment, she realized that the woman wasn’t just a reflection—she was trapped, imprisoned inside the mirror.</p><p>And Sarah was next.</p><hr><h2 id=the-forgotten-room>The Forgotten Room</h2><p>The next few days passed in a blur. Sarah couldn’t shake the feeling that something was watching her, waiting for the right moment to strike. She couldn’t sleep, couldn’t eat. Every corner of the house felt like it was closing in on her. Every creak of the floorboards, every rustle of the curtains, seemed to send her into a panic.</p><p>But it was the mirror that haunted her the most. Every time she passed by it, she felt its pull, urging her to look inside, to see the woman’s twisted face once more. But Sarah resisted. She couldn’t—she couldn’t let herself become lost in that reflection.</p><p>One evening, while exploring the house in a desperate attempt to find answers, Sarah stumbled upon a hidden door in the basement. It was small, almost unnoticeable, hidden behind a stack of old furniture. With trembling hands, she pried it open.</p><p>The room inside was small and cramped, filled with old, dusty boxes. But it wasn’t the contents that made Sarah’s blood run cold—it was the overwhelming sense of dread that filled the air, a suffocating presence that seemed to claw at her from all directions.</p><p>In the center of the room stood another mirror. But this one was different. It was old, its frame ornate and twisted, as though it had been designed to trap something—someone.</p><p>Sarah stepped closer, her heart pounding in her chest. She could feel the air growing colder, the silence growing heavier with each passing second. As she reached out to touch the mirror, a sudden, chilling gust of wind slammed the door shut behind her.</p><p>Trapped.</p><p>She whirled around, but the room was gone. Instead, she was standing in a forest—dark and foggy, the trees twisted and gnarled, their branches like skeletal fingers reaching out to snatch her. The ground beneath her feet was soft and uneven, as if the earth itself were alive.</p><p>And then she saw it.</p><p>The woman from the mirror.</p><p>She was standing just beyond the fog, her hollow eyes fixed on Sarah. She began to move, her slow, deliberate steps dragging her closer, the sound of her dress rustling like whispers in the dark.</p><p>Sarah’s breath caught in her throat as the woman’s mouth began to move. But there was no sound. No words. Only the image of her lips moving in a silent, mocking chant.</p><p>“Sarah…”</p><p>Suddenly, everything went dark.</p><hr><h2 id=the-return>The Return</h2><p>When Sarah woke, she was back in the basement, the hidden room before her. The mirror stood silent, unchanged. But she could feel it now, a presence in the air, lurking just beyond the glass.</p><p>She stepped back slowly, her mind racing. What had just happened? Was it a dream? Had it been real?</p><p>The door to the basement creaked open behind her, and Sarah turned, her heart in her throat. It was the same man who had sold her the house, standing in the doorway with a concerned look on his face.</p><p>“You shouldn’t have gone near the mirrors,” he said quietly, almost sadly.</p><p>“Why?” Sarah managed to choke out, her voice barely above a whisper.</p><p>“The mirrors,” he said, his voice heavy with regret, “are portals. They show you the past, the future, and everything in between. But they always take something in return. The spirits that reside in them… they never let go.”</p><p>Sarah didn’t speak. She simply turned and walked out of the room, the weight of his words heavy on her mind. As she passed the mirror one last time, she saw her own reflection—no longer alone.</p><p>The woman stood behind her.</p><p>And this time, she was smiling.</p><hr><p><strong>End.</strong></p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/ghost-stories/>Ghost Stories</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/midnight-haunts-terrifying-ghost-stories-to-read-in-the-dark/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Midnight Haunts: Terrifying Ghost Stories to Read in the Dark</span>
