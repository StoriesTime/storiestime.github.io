To be fair, the Thompsons had perfected the art of family awkwardness over the years.</p><p>This was no ordinary family gathering. It wasn’t just another turkey-and-pie holiday. No, this was the kind of gathering where an innocent question could spark an hour-long debate about the nuances of &ldquo;proper&rdquo; Thanksgiving etiquette. Where one wrong comment could lead to someone storming off in dramatic fashion, only to return an hour later, pretending they hadn&rsquo;t just had a full-blown argument with a plastic pumpkin.</p><p>It all began like every other year: the early arrivals, the crackling sound of a TV blaring the latest reality show, and Aunt Linda’s famous casserole, which she claimed had been passed down through generations, though nobody quite knew who in the family had actually made it. The smell of garlic and onions filled the air, making everyone ravenous and simultaneously wary of what kind of food “mystery casserole” they were about to ingest.</p><p><strong>The Early Bird Drama</strong></p><p>The first to arrive, as always, were Steve and his wife, Karen. Steve had been an early riser even as a child, something that had never sat well with the rest of the family. He had this need to be <em>early</em>—to the point where it bordered on obsessive. While everyone else was still rolling out of bed, Steve was already setting up folding chairs in the driveway. But it wasn’t just the early arrival that set Steve apart; it was the way he navigated through social interactions.</p><p>“Hey, Karen,” Steve said to his wife, who had just emerged from the car, “can you help me put up the flag? I’m thinking we need to start the tradition of waving a Thompson family flag every year. What do you think?”</p><p>Karen, who had not yet had her coffee and was still in the throes of early-morning grumpiness, gave him a look that could only be described as “slightly murderous.” &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t just make up traditions like that, Steve.&rdquo;</p><p>“It&rsquo;s all about setting the tone for the day!” Steve insisted, his voice filled with the kind of enthusiasm that suggested he&rsquo;d been planning this moment since last year.</p><p>“I just want to eat some food,” Karen muttered, dragging her feet as she walked past him.</p><p><strong>Aunt Linda&rsquo;s Casserole Saga</strong></p><p>Meanwhile, inside, Aunt Linda was making sure her casserole was displayed in the center of the table like a centerpiece, even though no one could really identify what it was made of. The casserole had become a sort of joke within the family. No one had the heart to say it outright, but every year, the casserole came back. It was as if the family was trapped in a time loop of casserole acceptance.</p><p>“Does anyone want some of my famous casserole?” Aunt Linda called out enthusiastically, her arms wide open as though she were unveiling the Sistine Chapel.</p><p>The table went silent for a beat. Every single eye subtly darted around, unsure of how to respond. Everyone had learned long ago that saying “no thanks” was a mistake. It would set off Aunt Linda&rsquo;s emotional firestorm. The key was to <em>act</em> like you were interested, maybe take a spoonful, and hope it didn’t have that <em>certain</em> rubbery texture that you could never quite place.</p><p>“I’ll have a bit,” said Cousin Emily, who had somehow mastered the art of feigning enthusiasm.</p><p>“Me too,” chimed in David, Uncle Bob’s son, who had no intention of actually eating it but was savvy enough to understand that saying “no” would result in Aunt Linda calling him “ungrateful” for the next three months.</p><p>For the next ten minutes, every person at the table had a spoonful of casserole, and no one spoke. The only sound was the clinking of forks, as they carefully chewed the mystery dish.</p><p>The awkwardness was palpable. It was as if the entire family was trying to maintain eye contact with each other without acknowledging the <em>unspoken truth</em> about Aunt Linda’s casserole.</p><p><strong>The Unsolicited Advice</strong></p><p>As the conversation shifted, it was inevitable that someone would bring up the topic of Steve and Karen&rsquo;s “upcoming move.” Every year, Steve had made vague promises about relocating to a “bigger house” in the suburbs. It was a dream he had nurtured for as long as anyone could remember, yet it never seemed to materialize.</p><p>“Steve,” Aunt Carol, the family’s self-proclaimed therapist, asked, “are you still planning on moving to that new house you keep talking about?”</p><p>Steve, ever the optimist, smiled and nodded. “Yep, just waiting for the right time. It’s all about finding a good deal, you know?”</p><p>“Have you considered moving to somewhere with less&mldr;traffic?” Aunt Carol continued, her voice laced with a thinly-veiled critique. “I mean, wouldn’t it be better for Karen if you didn’t have to spend so much time in that insane commute every day?”</p><p>Steve shifted uncomfortably in his seat. It was clear that Aunt Carol’s attempt at “helping” wasn’t exactly appreciated.</p><p>“Actually, we’re looking at some houses in the next neighborhood over,” Karen said quickly, shooting Steve a look that said, <em>Do not engage.</em></p><p>But it was too late. Steve, the eternal optimist, decided to expand on his vision for the perfect new home. “I’ve been thinking about it a lot. A backyard with a pool. And a study. Maybe a gym.”</p><p>The room fell silent. Aunt Carol, who was never one to back down from a challenge, leaned forward and squinted at him. “A gym? You do realize that everyone already has a gym membership, right? No one uses them, Steve.”</p><p>&ldquo;Not <em>everyone</em>,&rdquo; Steve retorted, suddenly on the defensive. &ldquo;I mean, some of us like to stay active.&rdquo;</p><p>And with that, the awkward silence deepened. The conversation was now a minefield of polite avoidance. The Thompson family reunion had just entered the second stage of awkwardness: <em>self-conscious defense mechanisms.</em></p><p><strong>Uncle Bob&rsquo;s Speech</strong></p><p>Then, of course, there was Uncle Bob. Uncle Bob, whose speeches were a notorious part of every gathering, had begun his annual tradition of “deep reflections on life” about fifteen minutes into dinner. His speeches often meandered into bizarre territory, touching on topics like the “nature of time” and “the futility of modern technology,” all while trying to relate it back to the family somehow.</p><p>“Do you ever think about how fast time passes?” Uncle Bob started, wiping his mouth dramatically, a piece of turkey still dangling from his lip. “I mean, one moment, you&rsquo;re holding a child, and the next thing you know, they&rsquo;re all grown up. And then, the next thing you know&mldr;”</p><p>Aunt Linda rolled her eyes from the other end of the table. “Bob, no one cares about your weird thoughts. We just want to eat our food in peace.”</p><p>But Uncle Bob, unphased, continued, “And isn’t that the beauty of it? The passage of time. One day, we’ll look back on these family gatherings, and we’ll realize&mldr; we were all together. As a family.”</p><p>There was a long pause. Everyone knew the drill. The awkward silence that followed was met with the obligatory <em>murmurs of agreement,</em> even though everyone secretly longed to change the subject.</p><p>“Right,” said Steve, clinking his glass to break the tension. “So, um&mldr; anyone want to play a game?”</p><p><strong>The Family Talent Show</strong></p><p>It wasn’t long before someone suggested the infamous family talent show, which was, as usual, a train wreck in the making. There were always a few brave souls willing to perform, but the results were often hilariously bad.</p><p>Cousin Emily, ever the performer, decided this year she would grace the family with her <em>interpretive dance</em>. It was clear that her lack of formal training had not deterred her. She flailed around the living room to a song that no one recognized, desperately trying to keep in time with the music.</p><p>Everyone watched, frozen in disbelief. No one knew whether to clap or look away in shame.</p><p>After about five minutes of awkwardly wriggling, Emily stopped, out of breath and beaming. “Thank you, thank you! I’ll be here all night!”</p><p>The applause was, to say the least, <em>polite</em>.</p><p><strong>The End</strong></p><p>Eventually, as the day drew to a close, and the last bit of casserole had been devoured (or at least discreetly left on the plate), the family gathered for the traditional group photo. Each year, this ritual was accompanied by the same routine: someone had forgotten to charge the camera, someone else was too busy looking for a sweater, and someone, inevitably, would blink at the wrong moment. But as they stood together, smiling awkwardly at the camera, one thing was clear: the Thompsons wouldn’t have it any other way.</p><p>Because, for all the chaos, the weird traditions, and the unspoken rules of avoiding uncomfortable topics, it was the unshakable bond of family that made it all worth it.</p><p>And, maybe, just maybe, that was the <em>real</em> tradition.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/comedy-and-humor/>Comedy and Humor</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/hilarious-tales-comedy-short-stories-to-tickle-your-funny-bone/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Hilarious Tales: Comedy Short Stories to Tickle Your Funny Bone</span>
