Dappled in the sickly yellow and weak neon of the corridor lights, the storeroom murmured, “Find me.” Merrin was twenty-three, short, unhappy, and convinced her own work was a parade of failures in chalky pastel. She took the bait.</p><p>She didn’t need much of an excuse to disappear for hours, ducked unseen by teachers and classmates – the faculty, she sometimes joked, couldn’t spot her if she wore a neon vest and twirled flaming brushes. Merrin drifted past the studio doors, pressed fingertips to a peeling map of the Institute, traced her way upward.</p><p>Upstairs, purple light fractured through dust in a forgotten window. An old plaque on the door read “Supplies: Archive.” Her heart banged a frantic tattoo, like something inside her meant to leap out. She fiddled the lock with a stolen bobby pin: click. Then, she was through.</p><p>Inside lay chaos so serene only time could have composed it. Towers of sketchbooks, fossilized erasers. Unlabelled boxes and, by the window, a trunk battered to exhaustion. Nestled inside, wrapped in linen that felt impossibly soft, were glass vials. The labels were all but faded—a peacock swirl, the tilt of someone’s handwritten “M.” Merrin eased one out. Liquid shimmered, indigo through and through, like it could dye dreams.</p><p>Her first painting with the paints was reckless. At her desk that night, with the tiny vial uncorked, she dragged the brush in wide strokes across a sheet and tried to let whatever wanted to escape her flow. It came easily—too easily. The colors spilled so rich and alive, almost breathing, swirling in patterns she’d only ever seen in her sleep: geometric, impossible, storm-lit.</p><p>Around 3 AM, she stood back. Before her was a self-portrait, but not as she normally appeared—this was a Merrin wreathed in tangled gold, haloed by rebellious light, a woman who could step from canvas to world with a challenging grin. Merrin stared, breathless, swallowing a slow-growing dread. Did she paint this, or did it paint her?</p><p><strong>Shadows of Doubt</strong></p><p>Weeks ticked by in a whirl. Word spread of her new style. Classmates dropped by, pretending not to look jealous. The old professors, usually so buried in their own routines they didn’t recognize their own shoes, started stopping her in the corridor. “Stunning color work, truly.” “I never saw those transitions before. Your technique has grown. Unusual.”</p><p>Merrin smiled, thanked them, then returned to her dorm room and stared at her hands. She didn’t know who she was in these paintings—she was painting a person who rarely showed up anywhere in her own sort-of-life. Something about the paints let her reach for bravery, for vividness, but outside of her work she still stammered when asked her opinion, still burned with self-critique every time a brush slipped.</p><p>It got so she couldn’t touch the regular paints anymore. Their colors looked flat beside the magical vials. Her friends noticed. Jules, her closest friend since first year, pressed a coffee mug into her hands one rainy Thursday and said, “You’re chasing something. The art’s fierce, Merrin. But you—you seem scared.”</p><p>Merrin wanted to snap back, to say all artists were scared, it was what made art worth anything. Instead, she said, “Maybe I’m not the person doing this. Not really.”</p><p>They sat in heavy silence.</p><p>Jules broke it: “You make it. No one else. The paint’s just a tool. Not a magic wand.”</p><p>But Merrin wondered, as she weighed the vial in her palm that afternoon, if she was fooling both Jules and herself.</p><p><strong>A New Vision</strong></p><p>The Institute’s annual student exhibition approached—Merrin’s chance to show her portfolio to galleries, critics, and people who might actually buy a piece. Her mentor, Professor Harrold, asked to see her new work. She set the latest painting—a great sweeping beast of cerulean and carmine, a cityscape twisting under a wild sky—before him.</p><p>He stared at it for a long time. “It’s breathtaking,” he said, his hands trembling on the easel. “There’s something in it… you never held this kind of power before, did you?”</p><p>“It comes from these,” Merrin blurted, voice wobbly, trembling more than Harrold’s. She should have lied. She pulled the vials from her backpack, watched as his eyes widened.</p><p>He did not say all the right things. He did not assure her her talent was hers alone. He leaned forward, eyes alight, and said, “Merrin. Do you know what you’ve found? Rumor had it these paints could let artists see their unconscious made visible. Some warned it might show us more of ourselves than we want. Maybe that’s what every great work of art does.”</p><p>She shook her head. “But what if the visions aren’t real? What if this is just the paint?”</p><p>Harrold grinned. “If the paint makes you believe in what you’re seeing, isn’t that real enough? Don’t sell yourself short. Doubt is part of the process. Use it.”</p><p>She took her canvas and went, skirts brushing against her knees, unsure if she felt reassured or more uncertain than ever.</p><p><strong>Night of Dreams</strong></p><p>The night before the exhibition, the Institute transformed—lights tangled in the gallery corridors, faculty fussing over wine and cheese, students clutching portfolios as if their very lives depended on it. (Maybe they did, for a moment.) Merrin’s slot was prime, at the bend in the gallery where everyone would see.</p><p>Her display was seven paintings, brilliant and wild, each born of the storeroom vials. She hovered to the side as the critics wove through. Some gazed thoughtfully; a few murmured their notes to one another. But a woman—mid-thirties, hair to her knees, silvered and sharp, stepped right up and spent an inordinate amount of time with the first canvas.</p><p>“Raw,” the woman said at last. “I haven’t seen fear this naked in a long time. Tell me—” she turned to face Merrin, “Were you scared or angry when you painted this?”</p><p>Neither, nor both. “Lost,” Merrin replied, gut honest.</p><p>“Good,” the woman nodded. “Art needs that. The world will polish you down, smooth your edges. Don’t let it.”</p><p>As the critics moved on, Merrin realized for the first time in weeks she didn’t care for their approval or the rumors of the magical paint. She had been chasing something, but not validation—she wanted to know if a lost person could create, fiercely, in the teeth of their own doubt.</p><p>The vials, nearly spent now, lined up on the table. Their contents glittered less, as if they’d given Merrin all they had.</p><p><strong>Unveiling the Self</strong></p><p>In the gray morning after the gala, Merrin returned to her studio, now as familiar as her own breathing. She reached for her mass-market oils, the paint tubes everyone used. She hesitated, half expecting to feel flat, uninspired. Instead, something inside her tugged.</p><p>She picked up her brush and began painting—not feverishly, not desperately; slowly and purposefully, like starting a letter to herself. The colors lacked the magic shimmer of the vials, but her hand felt steadier, like it now remembered a route through chaos. She rendered what she felt in cool ochre, storm-blurred lines and uncertain curves. Each stroke was an assembling of selves: not a hero, not a fraud, just Merrin, painting anyway.</p><p>For the first time since rediscovering the storeroom, she barely thought of loss or magic. She didn’t chase some shining ideal, didn’t imagine a future in a gallery, or a critic’s approving nod. The doubt was still there, at her shoulder, whispering about her limitations, but she turned toward it and painted her way through.</p><p>Days later, new works began to fill her room—not as radiant as the earlier ones, not as envied, but evident, real. People stopped by and noticed her style had shifted, subtler and, somehow, more alive. Jules caught her in the corridor. “Still chasing dreams?”</p><p>Merrin smiled. “Learning how to live with them.”</p><p><strong>A New Palette</strong></p><p>Months passed. Merrin shared her secret with no one else, packed the empty vials away. She visited the archive one last time, found the linen inside the trunk had fallen apart, the dust returned to soft confusion. Maybe the real magic had never been the paints, but what they pushed her to risk—vulnerability, uncertainty, mess.</p><p>She started teaching a beginner’s workshop for students as nervous as she’d once been. They stumbled over shaky lines; she reminded them: “What matters is letting yourself wonder what you might do, not fearing what you can’t yet.” She studied their efforts, saw flashes of their real, unvarnished selves: a girl’s awkwardly bold ocean; a boy’s powerfully clumsy fire. She held their efforts as precious.</p><p>At last, one quiet evening, Merrin set a new canvas on the easel. Light spilled from the window, rain glittered on the glass, and doubt shadowed the corner. She dipped her brush into standard blue and mixed a bit of storm into the hue. She painted, and the work was slow, difficult, but steadfast—layer over layer building a world where she belonged.</p><p>A finished piece at last—her truest yet. When she signed her name in the corner, Merrin felt herself settle into her own skin, artist and doubter and dreamer, made whole.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/art-and-creativity/>Art and Creativity</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/palette-dreams-how-creativity-transforms-ordinary-life/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Palette Dreams: How Creativity Transforms Ordinary Life</span>
