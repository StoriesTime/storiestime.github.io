I was sitting at my desk, minding my own business, trying to get a jumpstart on work. The usual Monday grind was in full swing when I received a text from my best friend, Sarah. Her message was simple enough: <em>&ldquo;How was your weekend?&rdquo;</em></p><p>I glanced at my phone and began typing my reply. For some reason, autocorrect decided to have a little fun with me that day. I meant to write, <em>&ldquo;It was pretty good, just relaxed at home and caught up on some shows.&rdquo;</em> However, what I actually sent was this:</p><p><em>&ldquo;It was pretty good, just relaxed at home and caught up on some shoves.&rdquo;</em></p><p>Yes, <em>shoves</em>. That’s right. Instead of &ldquo;shows,&rdquo; autocorrect changed it to something entirely nonsensical. Now, I can’t exactly blame my phone for this one—after all, “shoves” is a legitimate word, just one that doesn’t make sense in the context of a weekend binge-watch session.</p><p>I stared at the message for a solid few seconds before quickly correcting it and sending a follow-up message: <em>&ldquo;Oops, I meant shows, not shoves!&rdquo;</em> But by then, it was too late. Sarah had already seen the message and, of course, responded with her usual level of sarcasm: <em>“Oh, you were shoving things around all weekend? Sounds intense.”</em></p><p>I groaned internally. That was only the beginning. By Tuesday, autocorrect had already set its sights on my professional life.</p><p>I was in the middle of texting my colleague, John, about an important meeting we had scheduled for the week. We were supposed to discuss a few clients and make some final decisions on a project proposal. I started typing my message: <em>&ldquo;I’ll be there at 3 PM sharp for the meeting.&rdquo;</em></p><p>But autocorrect had different plans. It decided that “sharp” should be replaced with “sheep.” Now, my message read: <em>&ldquo;I’ll be there at 3 PM sheep for the meeting.&rdquo;</em></p><p>I stared at my screen in disbelief. I could only imagine the confusion that would ensue if John read that message without clarification. So, I quickly fired off a second message: <em>&ldquo;Oops! Not ‘sheep,’ I meant sharp. Haha, autocorrect strikes again.&rdquo;</em></p><p>John didn’t seem to mind. He replied with his usual cool tone: <em>“No problem, I’m sure the sheep will be a great addition to the meeting!”</em> I laughed it off, trying to save face. At least he had a good sense of humor about it, but I was starting to wonder if my phone had it out for me.</p><p>By Wednesday, the autocorrect disaster had reached new heights. I was chatting with my mom, catching up on some family stuff. We were talking about the weather when she asked me what the forecast was for the weekend. I meant to say, <em>“It’s supposed to be sunny and warm.”</em> But nope, autocorrect had other ideas. Instead, my message went out as:</p><p><em>&ldquo;It’s supposed to be sunken and warm.&rdquo;</em></p><p>I read it and immediately burst out laughing. Who even says &ldquo;sunken&rdquo; when talking about the weather? My mom, of course, caught the error right away. She replied with a message that made me choke on my coffee:</p><p><em>“Sunken? Is that some sort of new weather term? Should I prepare for a flood?”</em></p><p>I was on the verge of tears from laughing so hard. I quickly corrected the message and explained that I had meant “sunny.” But my mom was having way too much fun with it. She replied: <em>“I’ll make sure to check if the sunken weather arrives in time for my gardening!”</em></p><p>At that point, I was convinced that autocorrect was intentionally trying to ruin my life. The week was dragging on, and I just couldn’t escape the text mishaps. The next incident happened on Thursday when I was texting a potential new client about scheduling a call. I typed out a professional message, trying to be polite and clear:</p><p><em>&ldquo;It would be great to connect sometime this week.&rdquo;</em></p><p>You can guess what happened next. Autocorrect changed “connect” to “coconut,” and the message I sent read:</p><p><em>&ldquo;It would be great to coconut sometime this week.&rdquo;</em></p><p>I froze. I had no idea what that even meant. Was I supposed to offer the client coconuts? Was I making some weird joke? I quickly fired off another message to clarify: <em>“Sorry, I meant connect, not coconut. This autocorrect thing is getting out of hand!”</em></p><p>The client responded with: <em>“Haha, no problem! I’m curious now—what kind of coconut meeting are we having?”</em></p><p>By this point, I was seriously wondering if autocorrect was just trying to make me look ridiculous. It wasn’t even limiting itself to my personal texts anymore—it was messing with my work communication too. And the week wasn’t even over yet.</p><p>Friday came around, and I was texting Sarah again, this time about making plans for the weekend. We were trying to decide between seeing a movie or grabbing dinner. I meant to suggest a restaurant I liked, but instead, I ended up with this gem:</p><p><em>&ldquo;How about we go to The Shrimp Shack for dinner?&rdquo;</em></p><p>Well, “Shrimp Shack” was autocorrected to “The Shrimp Shack,” but for some reason, it also added a random “chicken” in the middle of the sentence. So the message read:</p><p><em>&ldquo;How about we go to The Chicken Shrimp Shack for dinner?&rdquo;</em></p><p>I knew Sarah was going to have a field day with this one. Sure enough, her response came through almost immediately: <em>“The Chicken Shrimp Shack? Is that where they serve chicken and shrimp together? I’m intrigued!”</em></p><p>I sighed, knowing that autocorrect was now officially the bane of my existence. I texted back, <em>“No, just shrimp. I meant to say Shrimp Shack, not Chicken Shrimp Shack. Autocorrect is having a meltdown.”</em></p><p>The rest of the weekend went by with no more major autocorrect blunders—at least none that I noticed. However, I couldn’t help but laugh at how many mishaps had piled up over just a few days. Autocorrect had taken me on a wild ride that week, from shoves to sheep to sunken weather and coconut meetings.</p><p>In a way, I kind of appreciated it. The constant missteps had provided me with some much-needed humor during an otherwise typical week. I mean, who needs a comedy show when you’ve got autocorrect messing with your texts?</p><p>Looking back on it now, I’ve learned to double-check my messages before hitting send, but I’ll never forget the sheer chaos that autocorrect brought to my life that week. It may have caused some embarrassment and confusion, but it also reminded me not to take things too seriously and to always find a little humor in the chaos.</p><p>I still use autocorrect, of course, but now, I approach it with a healthy amount of skepticism. It’s always ready to turn my simple “hello” into a “hellhound” or change my “weekend plans” to “weird plans” just when I least expect it. I’ve learned to embrace the randomness, though—because, at the end of the day, it’s the little mishaps that make life a bit more interesting.</p><p>And if nothing else, they make for great stories to share with friends. So, here’s to autocorrect: the silent comedian that strikes when you least expect it and provides an endless source of laughter.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/comedy-and-humor/>Comedy and Humor</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/weekend-warriors-a-camping-trip-gone-hilariously-wrong/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Weekend Warriors: A Camping Trip Gone Hilariously Wrong</span>
