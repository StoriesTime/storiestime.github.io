Mountains floated in the distance, their jagged peaks impaled on clouds that glimmered with iridescence. The ground wasn’t solid but rather a mosaic of clocks melting into pools of shadows, shifting incessantly like restless thoughts in a dream.</p><p>Sophia woke—or at least, believed she had awakened. She wasn’t in her bed. Nor was she in the apartment overlooking Manhattan’s relentless pulse. No, she was somewhere else entirely, a place so untethered that it felt as though every law of nature had been unraveled, warped and reassembled by a mind far more eccentric than her own. It was surreal, yes, but strangely inviting.</p><p>The grass beneath her feet was blue and feathered, brushing against her ankles as if it had thoughts of its own. She took a step forward, observing the landscape. To her left, a giraffe walked by, its elongated neck sprouting flames like a lantern, the embers licking the wind but never consuming its body. To her right stood trees with leaves made of bent mirrors, each reflecting Sophia—but not as she was now. One mirror showed her as a child, wide-eyed and curious, clinging to her mother’s hand at a carnival. Another revealed a hunched, aged version of herself, staring back dolefully from a hunched posture. She shivered and turned away.</p><p>“Don’t look at that too long,” said a voice that seemed to bubble up from nowhere, like champagne fizzing out of thin air. Sophia turned sharply and found herself face-to-face—or perhaps face-to-clock—with a creature. Its face was flat and blank, a giant clock with roman numerals vaguely glowing against bronze mechanisms. The arms of the clock moved lazily, dragging time through the mire of eternity. Its body was humanoid, dressed in a waistcoat that shimmered like oil on water. Despite the creature&rsquo;s odd appearance, its voice was warm and familiar.</p><p>“Where am I?” Sophia managed to ask, though her tongue felt tangled in the syrupy thickness of the air.</p><p>“You’ve crossed over,” replied the clock-faced being, ticking softly as it spoke. “Moved from the rigid confines of waking rationality into the boundless dreamscape. Welcome to the Horizon.”</p><p>“The Horizon?” Sophia echoed. The words tasted strange on her tongue but not unpleasant. She wanted to understand, but her mind felt stretched like taffy, scrambling to cling to anything tangible amidst the burning giraffes and mirror-leaved trees.</p><p>“Your imagination has always touched this place,” the creature continued. “Only now, as you slumber, you’ve crossed fully. Salvador created this world long ago, letting his musings spill outwards like an overturned paint jar.”</p><p>The name Salvador tickled a memory. Dali. Salvador Dali. Of course. The melting clocks, the impossible landscapes. She realized now that she stood within a world carved from his genius—or madness. “I’m dreaming, then.”</p><p>The creature’s voice grew coy. “Are you? Is that what you believe?”</p><p>Sophia glanced past it toward a hill undulating like waves. Atop the hill perched what seemed like a half-melted wooden structure—a staircase leading to nowhere but climbing all the same. The sight filled her with an almost magnetic pull. “I need to understand. What’s beyond that hill?”</p><p>“You’ll find out,” the creature answered with a whir of clockwork, already receding into the shadows that pooled arbitrarily across the ground. “Or perhaps you won’t.”</p><p>Sophia pushed forward, her shoes sinking slightly into the feathers of blue grass. With every step, her surroundings shifted as though the land itself inhaled and exhaled. A fish swam through the air beside her, its body transparent to the point of being invisible—except for its luminous skeleton, which glowed faintly like a lantern on a foggy night.</p><p>The staircase began to loom larger. As she approached, she realized it wasn’t what she initially thought. Its melted form housed doors along the sides that seemed to spiral upwards, each door uniquely shaped and colored. One was shaped like a triangle and appeared sealed, crusted over with seashells. Another resembled a perfect oval, glowing faintly and inscribed with text—not in any language she recognized, but still somehow readable in her mind: <em>The Past Calls.</em></p><p>She hesitated at the base, debating whether to open any of them. A sound interrupted her thoughts—a low hum vibrating from above. She looked up, squinting through the strange air, and saw that the staircase stretched impossibly high into the fiery gold sky. It didn’t lead nowhere, as she’d assumed. It seemed interconnected to some vast structure that looked almost alive, breathing in long, unsteady rhythms.</p><p>Sophia couldn’t resist the pull anymore. She placed a tentative foot on the first step and ascended. Each step was soft beneath her feet, yet sturdy. The hum grew louder as she climbed, becoming a rhythm of ticking and dripping, as if an orchestra conducted time and dreams themselves. She felt lighter as she climbed—as though gravity wasn’t entirely interested in keeping her tied to Earth.</p><p>The first door she reached had an auburn shimmer and looked like it had been carved from bark twisted by flame. Sophia stopped, laying a hand on it. Warmth pulsed beneath her fingertips, like blood coursing through skin rather than wood. Unbidden, the door swung open, revealing a room overflowing with hundreds of floating roses, their blooms flashing vivid colors that matched no earthly spectrum. Among these flowers stood a figure wrapped in heavy silk, gazing wistfully into an enormous basin filled with liquid that swirled pictures rather than reflections.</p><p>“Who are you?” Sophia asked.</p><p>The figure turned, revealing Salvador Dali himself—or at least, an iteration of him. His mustache curled upward in improbable arcs. His gaze burned like amber lit from within.</p><p>“I am nothing,” Salvador said, his voice both distant and resounding. “But everything that lingers in the corners of thought. Tell me, Sophia, what do you dream of most?”</p><p>“I don’t know,” Sophia admitted, feeling her heart race.</p><p>His hand emerged from the folds of silk and gestured to the basin. “Look carefully, and you’ll remember.”</p><p>Sophia stepped closer, peering over the edge. The liquid inside swirled as if alive, showing fragments of her life: herself as a girl, building sandcastles. Her first kiss. Her disappointment of unanswered ambitions. And then there were images she didn’t recognize—versions of her, wandering through undiscovered lands with a lantern in hand, feeding fire to the burning giraffes to watch them grow bright enough to light the dusk.</p><p>“What are these?” she asked.</p><p>“Are they memories stolen from you?” Dali mused, turning away. “Or wishes waiting to be unveiled?”</p><p>Sophia stepped back, overwhelmed. As she retreated, Dali bowed slightly but never followed her. The floating roses began to shimmer brighter, blinding her into closing the door.</p><p>Outside, the staircase still beckoned her upward, and without pausing she resumed her climb. More doors awaited, along with more questions—and perhaps, answers. She wasn’t sure whether she wanted either, but she continued upward all the same.</p><p>As the horizon melted into further impossibilities, Sophia realized this world didn’t have to be conquered to be understood. It would simply exist, as it always had, cradling every oddity waiting to emerge from the human mind.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/artistic-movements/>Artistic Movements</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/surreal-dreams-navigating-the-subconscious-in-art/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Surreal Dreams: Navigating the Subconscious in Art</span>
