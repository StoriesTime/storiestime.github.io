The wheatfield stretched out as far as her eyes could reach, a landscape of gold whispering secrets under the morning's gentle breeze.
Emma had toiled on that land for six years, inherited from her dear grandfather. Growing up, memories of her youthful summers spent combing through their fields for cicadas and hand-picking lavender still danced vibrant in her waking thoughts. Their family's simple farmhouse, clad in the rugged stone of hills, was rooted in this cherished land. Wherever she took a step around Willow Creek would echo the voices of her folk.
As August suns became increasingly sweltering, moisture in the ripening wheat seeped heavy into the dust. The very air cladded with a misty, orange hue at peak sunset. Fields were not untouched, but nurtured, giving rise to secrets and tales about each crop variation. Her children would spend all day watching ripening ears tremble, convinced they heard enchanted whispers of whispers.
The local market at Blackstone would demand a particular arrangement of crops which suited their region's needs just right. Thus, the daily routine involved coordinating the timing—harvest—of crops around these seasonal transitions. It remained an unsteady dance, demanding a keen weather eye. Willow Creek had lost its last standing tree, downed by this spring's first thunderstorm for the first two decades. Each new day still brought whispers when the sun made its morning show.
The previous harvest, crops had turned richly brown ahead of schedule owing to the exceptional rainfall in December. It reminded Emma of '37, only this time in the reverse rhythm. As then, this overgrowth demanded selective thinning under the summer glare. Her memories were full on how their elder had, more than once shared stories of struggles in years leading up to one of the grimmest regional famines his lifetime witnessed which was said often to be forgotten in times away from such happenings.
Today, however marked the first moment she would hand over a bulk of her farming responsibilities to Jethro at Willow Creek–the farm laborer she always thought would assume the mantle seamlessly. His reliability was an enigma she loved. He began by helping arrange the rows correctly. She sensed an under-toned urgency of sorts. Unfamiliar footsteps, not far away, snapped her attention instantly. She'd grown used listening to Jotham, this new hired-help, working just beyond the eastern fence.
Before the harvest officially began, two weeks ago news of an archeological village discovery near Potters farm spread through conversations. A sudden change had captured everyone's immediate attention, it was an entirely new way folks would discuss seasons ahead. Each time a field would grow dense with life–or a certain harvest time – Emma sensed hidden voices speaking low in her waking thoughts. An eerie, timeless feeling seemed not just her legacy but an active, guiding narrative of her inherited land.
Willow Creek field was alive again. As that first summer crop began to form, she still heard those summer cicadas amidst the rippening ears shaking gently. Then there were some whispers from distant trees which Jethro began to say whispered the stories through wind.
From that moment going forward, summer's air didn't seem stale anymore.
The land where she'd bequeathed responsibility to Jother, still would tell its deep-rooted chronicles to Willow Creek. On a certain June morning, whispers would carry that land's forgotten tales through open fields of those golden, swinging ears of which Emma was soon to pass command.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/rural-life-and-agriculture/>Rural Life and Agriculture</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/whispers-of-the-wheat-field-stories-from-a-farmers-daughter/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Whispers of the Wheat Field: Stories from a Farmer's Daughter</span>
