It happened at a grocery store barely five blocks from his apartment in Morgan Park. He gripped his mother’s hand, distracted by the cereal aisle’s cacophony of mascots, while she recited the shopping list in her mind. Out of nowhere, a woman—white, hair piled high, clutching her purse—gave a quick tug to her son’s shoulder when Jamal wandered too close. The boy was three, maybe four. The mother’s whisper was just audible over the collective hum: “Stay close, honey.” Jamal only remembered the sting, not his mother&rsquo;s response.</p><p>Years later, Jamal would call his mother and ask, “You remember that day in the Aldi when the woman pulled her kid away from me?” His mother always replied, “Which one?”</p><p>By high school, Jamal had summer jobs: the library, then food delivery, then the Sears at Evergreen Plaza. There, he learned a thousand invisible rules. Fold the shirts obsessively. Never use your phone on the floor. Smile until your cheeks cramp. Once, during a slow shift, he asked Carmen, his supervisor, if he could take out the trash rather than stand at the register. She hesitated, glancing behind her. “You know how it is,” she whispered with trained nonchalance. “Some of our customers… get nervous. Just be—careful.” Jamal was sixteen and understood what she’d left unspoken.</p><p>He folded himself into less threatening shapes: hands visible, posture slack not to startle, presentation neat. He practiced raising his eyebrows in greeting, smoothing the edge off his deepest voice. Unmasking the bias in others meant playing his part first, like an actor learning which lines to skip so the audience didn’t flinch.</p><p>His first college roommate, Trevor, arrived with a hockey bag bulging with Gatorade and an easy habit of pushing boundaries. They both liked music—Vince Staples, King Krule, Radiohead—and afternoons in their dorm thickened with thumping bass and snatches of guitar. In those first weeks, Trevor wanted to talk about “the city.” He asked if Jamal had ever been shot at.</p><p>“Nah,” Jamal replied, a mild incredulity curdling his response. “It’s not like that everywhere.”</p><p>Trevor nodded, but his questions grew: What gang colors did people wear? Was it true police just ignored calls if you lived in the ‘wrong’ neighborhood? After Trevor’s older brother visited, Trevor kept bringing up diversity, pronouncing it with a labored emphasis that sounded like mockery. Once Jamal suggested they hit a show downtown; Trevor’s brother tagged along and told Jamal, half-joking, “You’re basically my cultural advisor, man.” Jamal laughed, short and sharp, feeling the joke’s edges.</p><p>College was supposed to be a place where biases fell away—so Jamal was told by guidance counselors, admissions brochures, and movies—but they just arrived camouflaged. In chemistry lab, partners picked each other quickly, leaving Jamal the last one unchosen three times in a row. The TA apologized each time—officially, everyone was “too shy.” On a late winter day, Jamal caught himself walking the campus green, headphones insistent in his ears, counting the number of sideways glances he got in ten minutes. Seven. He stopped doing that after a week.</p><p>He wondered if that vigilance was what his mom meant when, at dinner before he left for college, she’d said, “Always know where you are. Not everyone will see you for you.” Jamal thought he did—he dressed like every other kid shuffling into lecture, ate pizza from the Union, laughed at memes in the group chat. But some days, it felt as if his presence in these spaces was an experiment, an outlier’s data point.</p><p>He joined the campus newspaper mostly for the free bagels and an excuse to skip late lectures. On assignment at a local city council meeting, Jamal sat scribbling furiously, trying to make sense of the jargon: ordinances, waivers, infrastructure. During a break, he wandered the lobby, coffee in hand, as clusters of residents circled in discussion. A woman, thin-lipped and brisk, asked him which councilwoman he interned for.</p><p>“Oh, I’m with the paper. Doing a piece on housing permits,” he replied.</p><p>She nodded but didn’t return his smile. “It’s good to see young people getting involved. Interesting topic,” she said, her last words trailing uncertainty. He understood what she meant: it’s good to see someone like you here.</p><p>That initial spark—of being “the only”—followed him everywhere. Meetings, study groups, campus social events. Sometimes, a careless comment: why do you talk so “proper”? Did your parents really both go to college? Or: You’re so lucky, scholarships must’ve been easy.</p><p>Some offenses were bold, some invisible. Once, a professor assigned a group project on policing policy. All eyes flicked to Jamal. One classmate muttered, “We should lean on Jamal’s experience with this stuff.” Jamal asked, “What stuff?” Silence hung, uncomfortable. He could see them fumbling for explanations that wouldn’t sound bad, trying to pawn off their own ignorance as empathy.</p><p>Jamal’s solution was to keep moving forward—spend less time at parties and more time with headphones, less time debating and more time writing stories. He covered campus protests, city budget meetings, and student housing debates until his bylines were familiar. He kept his prose tight and his topics broad: never too personal. When editors sometimes suggested he write about “race issues,” Jamal would say, “What, in the cafeteria lines?” But sometimes, privately, he’d scribble notes about his own encounters—small, daily, hard to classify. He didn’t know if they added up to anything anyone would bother to print.</p><p>After graduation, Jamal took a reporting job in St. Louis. It wasn’t his top choice—but student loans made the decision for him. His first major assignment was an analysis of hiring trends at a tech startup downtown. He interviewed the company’s founder, staff, even the office receptionist. The data showed what he expected: overwhelmingly white, male, degrees from three schools.</p><p>“Diversity is something we’re working on,” the founder assured him, eyes flickering above Jamal’s head.</p><p>“Any concrete steps?” Jamal prompted.</p><p>“We post our jobs on a bunch of sites,” she replied. “But you know, you can’t force people to apply.”</p><p>Jamal’s article was praised for its “objectivity.” Editors said it “avoided being preachy.” Yet none of them asked about the moment he walked into the startup’s glass lobby, only to have the front desk worker wave him back out, assuming he was a courier. He waited for thirty minutes before someone realized the reporter was the guy in the blue jacket, clutching a notepad, who’d been standing politely near the door, ignored.</p><p>He wrote about policies and numbers, but privately he kept his own inventory: the way cab drivers sometimes passed him for the next guy, how bank tellers asked him twice if he needed “the regular account or the student one,” the low hum of suspicion when he lingered anywhere too long. Jamal became his own field study, collecting evidence.</p><p>But the pieces that haunted him most weren’t the ones about big policies. Jamal wrote an op-ed, quietly published in a midweb zine, describing a night at a restaurant with friends. They huddled around a table, laughter loud and tipsy, plates half-emptied. When the check arrived, the waiter automatically handed it to Jamal. Everyone went silent. Three of his friends reached for their wallets, but Jamal’s eyes locked with the waiter’s—a thin, nervous man who realized, instantly, the presumption he’d made. “Sorry, my mistake,” he muttered, distributing checks. No one said anything else, but Jamal’s friends blushed. The moment clung to the table long after dessert.</p><p>The op-ed went modestly viral. Comments rolled in—some hostile, some supportive, many trying to debate whether it was “really about race.” Jamal didn’t reply to any of them. What could he say? Sometimes bias arrived like a slap, sometimes a whisper, sometimes just a question: Do you belong here?</p><p>One day, months after the op-ed, Jamal was invited to talk at a local high school. The auditorium was filled with students, shuffling to attention. He talked about journalism, the stories people miss, how context mattered, how seeing the small patterns revealed the bigger ones.</p><p>During the Q&amp;A, a girl in a navy sweatshirt with a knotted headband stood up. “You write about all this stuff,” she said, “but does it get any better?”</p><p>The auditorium was silent. All the speeches Jamal had prepared didn’t seem enough. He thought of every time bias had tried to pin him in place, of every moment he’d adjusted his tone, smile, posture. He didn’t want to lie—he hated how advice sometimes slipped into empty reassurance.</p><p>So he told her the truth. “Some days it feels lighter, some days the weight is the same. What gets better is how you see it, and how you deal with it. What I try to do—what you can do—is shine a light on it, make it visible. That’s where change starts.”</p><p>Afterward, as the auditorium emptied, the girl found him backstage.</p><p>“I just want you to know…” she hesitated, twisting her knuckles, “some of us notice. I see it too.”</p><p>Jamal nodded, relief blooming in his chest. In that moment, it wasn’t about fixing everything, but about unmasking what was hidden—naming it, seeing it, and refusing to shrink around it. He wasn’t sure if that was hope, or just clarity. But as he walked to his car—keys jangling, footsteps echoing on the sidewalk—he felt a little less alone, and a little more himself.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/racism-and-prejudice/>Racism and Prejudice</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/unmasking-bias-a-journey-to-understanding/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Unmasking Bias: A Journey to Understanding</span>
