Tonight, the former spy and assassin was draped in shadows, perched atop an ancient clock tower overlooking the sprawling, chaotic labyrinth of the city below. He gazed through the red-draped lenses of his monocle down to where his prey resided, smirking disdainfully as he remembered the chilling symphony of agony that had once sung from his own lacerated flesh.</p><p>Prominent across the asphalt, spray-painted vivid crimson obeying the eternal laws of graffiti artistry - The Order of the Crimson Hand. The deranged cult had branded their insignia with the blood of all Nikolaus had once cherished and ultimately lost to their devious machinations. Sweltering in the heat of long-forgotten wrath, he clenched his fist tight, his breath turning icy as visions of shattered lives danced before his vengeful vision.</p><p>They took everything.</p><p>They took his mission.</p><p>They took his identity.</p><p>They took his humanity.</p><p>They took his heart.</p><p>But The Silent Assassin had stolen something right back from these agents of chaos.</p><p>He had stolen their silence.</p><p>The man in shadows had once been a herald of peace, a secret guardian of the innocent and suppressed. Agents of the very system he&rsquo;d vowed to protect had dispatched him with a dire either/or ultimatum. Discredit the very organization he cared for, or let the agents of the Order coerce the information from him - shatter the intricate web of secrets he&rsquo;d strived to protect.</p><p>Hence, Nikolaus had taken the path of the unfaithful, the betrayer – and thus, the rogue. Stripped from his purpose, judgment spurning his heart like the accursed relic it had become, he manufactured for himself a new existence. This time around, his banner bore ruthless retribution soaring high atop its mast. They&rsquo;d wounded him, they&rsquo;d maimed him, but they hadn&rsquo;t killed him. Or had they?</p><p>The once-only adversary had since wielded their blade justly, as was promised upon the resurrection of their sanctified cause. He&rsquo;d been a man eulogizing his own epitaph, that begrudging requiem bereft of melody soared into pursuits of darkness, stimulating a thirst for retribution that would set the ebon abyss ablaze.</p><p>This was the reason that Nikolaus found himself on the top of this old clocktower, the night sky his canvas and his coat - dark as his darkest secrets. He gripped the polished steel of his modified Ascolto AICasar 22 sniper rifle. It shared his obsession with precision, paying equal mind to its bride and victim.</p><p>Eyes narrowed, Nik scrutinized the moon on the horizon – not a celestial phenomenon, but a watchful sentinel, as plenty of nights had he crept under its vigilant demeanor. Full, afire, crescent – every phase of the moon&rsquo;s dance quantified the steps of his revenge.</p><p>His bony finger caressed the silenced muzzle of his weapon, the coldness writhing against his touch and then relaxing. The celestial body controlling the forecast soothed his polarized perspective. He never took risks or battled without righteousness guiding him. His was an undying vendetta wrapped within the doctrine of suitable vengeance and righteousness.</p><p>But our beliefs are inherently Newtonian, as our understanding of balance and gravity precedes. Irony played snapshots of its celestial proposition in Nikolaus&rsquo;s mind—a necromantic assortment lest his duality of faith took wing—thus allowing the order of the Crimson Hand to arise from the abyss. Thus, suppressing his own spiritual ascension manifested, unable to shake-off the chains of cruel fate strung about his heart.</p><p>Distractions ensnared his thoughts, the hum of a distant honest-to-goodness aeroplane droning past on unseen neurons that swirled him into a vaguely familiar dream. The wind appeared to be whispering the calculus of Nikolaus&rsquo;s impending doom to the open sky, insinuating hope was but a liar.</p><p>The contract man of virtue, indifference, and placidity waited, debt to be repaid by the masked cult that stole the very existence of himself.</p><p>Beneath the skyline, the silence of the night hungered for the agony of its long-awaited song.</p><p>&ldquo;This?&rdquo; Nikolaus murmured, caressing his muzzle lovingly. &ldquo;Is only the beginning.&rdquo;</p><p>Without warning, a stark cracking sound bulldozed the air apart, then whipped its pieces back into coherent harmony. A second gunshot, this time echoing insistently through the inky city below.</p><p>Soldiers of the Order, believed fetally blessed amidst the supernatural fold of darkness, materialized a hundred-strong in the dejected arsenal of an armed compound located just this side of hell itself. Like conquerors of a battlefield strewn amongst the powder keg that was human suffering, they prepared themselves for the onslaught to come.</p><p>Their eyes had been prepared, seared in the overwhelming glow of their distorted philosophy. Whispers among them conceived of the Silent Assassin weaving the gossamer web of his terror, entangling each hoof on this route to redemption. Nikolaus, once the smiling specter unburdened by the heavy chains of mortality, now bound at the neck by the merciless creed of a twisted fate.</p><p>Fire. Love. War. Betrayal. Death.</p><p>The next explosion of reality would mean the escalating crescendo of Nikolaus&rsquo;s grim performance art. Resting on the teetering edge of teetering madness, the assassins tucked into their own cloistered sanctuary, wearing the faces of the damned. Nikolaus had steeled himself for the shadow war staircase, brought forth to defend the righteousness as the knights of yore had against unbidden darkness.</p><p>The next round of shots began to ring into the distance, signaling the start of their cabaret of death that danced to the symphony of violence – savages melding together in a maelstrom, seeking absolution at the heart of chaos.</p><p>A breath, a thought, a strangled cry – as the Order of the Crimson Hand unleashed their wrath upon the &lsquo;hero who had forsaken their solemn duty. Nikolaus, dissolved beyond the shackles once ironclad tethering any righteousness he walked – had become the personal nemesis of all those he sought assuage after.</p><p>All Nikolaus saw, all he focused on, was the calculating and unhindered fulfillment of vengeance burning its ravenous ritual.</p><p>Suddenly, the darkness enveloped the thread that was Nikolaus&rsquo;s life – he knew not of sacrifice or turmoil. His body felt numb, all that existed around him a line as slender as the delicate whisper of cobweb at dawn. His eyes, the blind Pantheon, gazing onto the black abyss, welcoming the annihilation as if to rewrite the tableaux of defeat and disfigurement in the bitter ink of retribution.</p><p>Where was his human in the theater of nightmares, the stage ramped and robes rolled out? Nikolaus had become the damsel in distress, the subject of ravage and siege, a rippling vortex of emotional chaos.</p><p>But he, who had slain so many in the name of a ghostly retribution, had forgotten the derision stripes of his soul – bitten by the stealthy cancer that was the relentless marrow of vengeance.</p><p>Oh, had he departed far from the self he once graced?</p><p>A chilling thought punctured the variegated mist that wove its desolate tale amidst madness.</p><p>An epiphany.</p><p>Nik had become the shadow, and the crimson had spread into a devouring torrent - the true mark of his awful fall from grace.</p><p>In the distance, beyond the cries and roaring flames that spewed into waxen skies – in the thick of confusing gunpowder scent and a cacophony of unspeakable anguish - Nikolaus stumbled back a mighty step, his nimble legs feeling their way through the labyrinth of terror and torture.</p><p>Had there existed a prelude to the glorious curtain that would reveal a sanctified rebirth?</p><p>Perhaps.</p><p>But as Nikolaus, &ldquo;The Silent Assassin,&rdquo; wobbled back against the accursed slaughter that spewed from the heart of his tormented soul, there resounded one final echo carried upon the frigid contempt of the waves&rsquo; embrace.</p><p>It was the silence before the storm, the solemn requiem of the beast reined in its darkest hour.</p><p>This terrifying symphony didn&rsquo;t forecast impending cries for mercy.</p><p>It was the lament of the Heart.</p><p>His heart.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/betrayal-and-revenge/>Betrayal and Revenge</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-shadows-of-betrayal-a-cruel-pursuit-of-vengeance/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Shadows of Betrayal: A Cruel Pursuit of Vengeance</span>
