Lena pondered this as she sipped her lukewarm coffee on the windowsill. Streets bustled with the everyday symphony: traffic horns, the shriek of laughter from children dashing toward the playground, fragments of conversation wafting up to her third-floor apartment. She watched Mr. Huang in his familiar brown jacket, unlocking the iron gate to his dry cleaner’s shop, humming a tune audible even from her vantage point. Her own routine hovered before her like a lifeline. She had a meeting in 45 minutes, a sandwich to pack, a commute to brave. The day began as any other in March.</p><p>News murmurs had started to change, Lena noticed, in the past few weeks. Something about a virus, first murmured in coffee shops, then spoken in anxious calls between her mother and aunts, and finally, breaking through at boardroom tables and on her company’s group chat. But denial is its own sort of comfort. Lena had another thing to worry about: her annual review with her manager, Mara, coming up later today. She straightened her navy slacks, grabbed her faded canvas tote, and left her apartment, locking the door, double-checking as always.</p><p>Outside, the city vibrated with the careless energy of early spring. At the subway entrance, a busker played Beatles songs on a battered guitar. Mask-wearers were still rare; most passed by unbothered, their conversations huddled in close proximity, sharing coffee sips and gossip. Lena’s own mask was buried in her bag, given to her by her neighbor, Amara, a nurse. “Just in case,” Amara had said with a shrug. Lena smiled at the memory, feeling a pang of unease she quickly swatted away.</p><p>The train arrived, metallic and shrieking, crammed with bodies. Lena pressed herself against the doors, aware of every cough, every fleeting, sweaty touch as the car lurched along. Maybe, she thought, she should start biking to work. After all, the weather was warming up. She made a mental note and scanned the carriage: a teenager in a soccer jersey tapping at his phone, a woman in scrubs staring blankly at her reflection, an older man squeezing his eyes shut in conversation with another commuter.</p><p>At her stop, Lena moved with the crowd, exhaling the cloying air—she felt lighter on the sidewalk under the open sky. Her workplace, a compact four-story office, loomed ahead. This building, with its familiar creaky elevator and the smell of burned toast from the kitchenette, felt as solid and unyielding as time itself.</p><p>Inside, Mara waved from beyond the glass wall of a conference room. She was always the first to arrive, hair swept up in a tight bun, eyes already narrowed over a spreadsheet. Lena settled at her desk, greeted her teammates, and tried to quiet the butterflies in her stomach.</p><p>All morning, tasks dripped in one after another—emails from clients, project updates, a reminder that the team lunch was still planned at the new Thai restaurant around the corner. A group chat pinged to life: “Did you guys see the latest? NYC schools closed for two weeks!” Lena’s phone vibrated again: her mother, asking if she should stock up on canned goods.</p><p>Mara called Lena in for her review just before noon. The meeting played out in careful words and hesitant praise—all the usual metrics. Lena found her thoughts drifting, the office suddenly feeling too full, the air too close. Mara seemed distracted, peeking now and then at subtle notifications on her watch. Their conversation ended with a handshake, slightly awkward.</p><p>Lunch was loud. The restaurant&rsquo;s windows were flung open, sunlight painting yellow rectangles on wood flooring. Servers wove through tables, dropping plates of Pad Thai and green curry. Lena sat wedged between her officemates, pulled into debates about weekend plans. Someone mentioned a concert; another, a trip to New Orleans. There was disbelief—could the rumors be real? Would life pause so suddenly?</p><p>After lunch, the whispers grew louder. Lena’s phone vibrated with new headlines: the city council in urgent session; a friend’s cousin fell ill suddenly. By 3 p.m., the CEO called a meeting—everyone to the conference room, please. Jokes ricocheted around the glass-topped table as staff assembled, but laughter clawed uneasily at the edges. The CEO’s announcement unraveled with gentle insistence: prepare to work from home starting tomorrow. Pack what you need. “We don’t know for how long. Maybe a week. Maybe two.”</p><p>An unsettled quiet fell. Shortly after, desks emptied. Lena packed her essentials—laptop, notebook, chargers, mug—her hands moving automatically, mind reeling.</p><p>Outside, the city still thumped, but Lena saw it anew: the restaurant’s tables were emptier now, baristas discussed closures, friends embraced goodbye tighter than usual. Her phone buzzed with panicked texts—“Did you hear?” “Can you pick up rice on your way home?” “Should we all come stay at Mom’s?”</p><p>On the subway back, the crowd was thinner. Lena sat by the window and watched the city roll by. She noticed a woman weeping quietly into her phone, a man sanitizing his hands obsessively, an old couple holding hands for dear life. The reality weighed heavy: this might be their last normal commute, the last grasp at the routines they took for granted.</p><p>At home, Lena stood on her balcony as dusk draped itself across the skyline. She called her brother, reached her parents, messaged Amara, checked—twice—that she had everything she’d need for the coming days. Through the hum of anxious energy, she remembered to breathe. The perpetual ticking of her clock shattered the silence.</p><p>Late in the evening, Lena wandered to the corner bodega for supplies. Shelves told stories: the bread gone, the eggs and milk shelves barren save for a lone chocolate milk. The owner, usually so jovial, nodded at her with tired eyes. “Strange days,” he murmured.</p><p>Back in her building, Lena ran into her neighbor, Ms. Lopez, struggling with groceries.</p><p>“Let me help,” Lena offered. They climbed together, groceries distributed between their arms.</p><p>“I never thought I’d see… whatever this is,” Ms. Lopez sighed. “I remember old storms, brownouts—but this?”</p><p>Lena shook her head. “Feels like a movie.”</p><p>Doorways became thresholds not just between apartments, but between lives now paused, separated by uncertainties. They shared a smile, thin and genuine, before retreating into their respective homes.</p><p>Night fell. Lena sat on her bed, pajamas on, her laptop open. The evening news flickered—familiar anchors trying to sound reassuring. She scrolled endlessly: messages from friends, updates from work. The cadence of her world cracked, a hush settling over the city.</p><p>Elsewhere, Lena knew, doctors assembled in emergency rooms, scientists cross-checked their notes, families gathered with shared confusion and hope. But for Lena, the world had already gone still, the hands of the clock heavy and relentless. The last day of normal had slipped away quietly, footprints fading behind closed doors, routines dissolving into memory.</p><hr><p>The city, for the first time in her memory, sang its lullaby slowly—no whooping crowds, no shouts from the corner bar. Instead, the soft shuffle of neighbors, the creak of old plumbing, the echo of distant sirens. Lena lay in bed, eyes open, listening.</p><p>She promised herself she’d remember this day: the way the sunlight caught the edge of her desk, the sound of laughter from her team over curry, the warmth of Ms. Lopez’s groceries in her arms, the last rush of the old world before it paused. The curtains fluttered with the evening breeze, and somewhere in the quiet, the city dreamed of what might come after—after the silence, after the distance, after the long, strange pause.</p><p>Tomorrow, the world would be different. But tonight, for one last moment, Lena was home in that fragile, fading ordinary.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/pandemic-stories/>Pandemic Stories</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-last-day-before-lockdown-a-pandemic-short-story/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Last Day Before Lockdown: A Pandemic Short Story</span>
