The warm chatter of patrons inside mingled faintly with the hum of the street outside. She still had half an hour before her meeting with her coworker, Leah, but her chest felt constricted, her heart pounding like the sharp ticks of a clock. Every minute closer to stepping inside was like bracing against an oncoming wave she wasn’t ready to face.</p><p>Twenty-nine minutes now.</p><p>She adjusted the scarf around her neck and cursed herself under her breath. It was late spring—no one else was wearing scarves. Just another thing to make her stand out in a crowd where standing out felt like the greatest sin imaginable. Sophia didn’t dislike Leah. Leah was friendly, kind, and full of energy—the kind of energy Sophia wished she could borrow, just for one day. But eating together meant sitting at a table where other pairs of eyes could drift their way. The thought of it was enough to make her stomach turn.</p><p>Her fingers fumbled for her phone. Her greatest arsenal: the quick text cancellation. Maybe today wasn’t the best day for coffee. Maybe she had come down with an imaginary headache or an equally imaginary stomach bug. Lying came easily when the alternative was suffocating under the invisible weight of scrutiny. But her thumb hovered over the screen. She remembered Leah&rsquo;s bright, hopeful expression when they’d made their plans yesterday.</p><p>“We don’t hang out much!” Leah had said with a wide smile. “This’ll be fun, I promise.”</p><p>Sophia sighed and shoved the phone into her handbag. She’d just have to do it. One hour of pretending to be normal—that’s what she always told herself before encounters like this. She’d practice small talk, nod at the right moments, force a laugh even when her brain spiraled with the worry that she hadn&rsquo;t laughed the way people usually do.</p><p>Twenty-one minutes now.</p><p>The phrase she hated most—“It’s all in your head”—clung to her thoughts like gum stuck to a shoe. People said it casually, with the kind of laziness reserved for reassurances they threw out but didn’t mean. For Sophia, it wasn’t just in her head. It was in her chest, in her lungs, in her gut. It was in the way her voice trembled when strangers said “excuse me” as they brushed past her, or in the full-body exhaustion after pretending to relax during a simple conversation.</p><p>When she was younger, people assumed she was shy. Her teachers would encourage her to “speak up,” her classmates would nudge her at group projects with exasperated sighs. Even her parents would gently ask her why she wasn’t like her brother, who made friends as easily as he breathed. But this wasn’t shyness. Shyness was merely a flicker of hesitation compared to the wildfire that consumed her when she thought someone might judge her, laugh at her, or—worse—pity her.</p><p>She envied people who could walk into a crowded room as if they owned it, cracking jokes, commanding the attention of others. For Sophia, walking into a room meant becoming invisible or, at least, trying to. Her inner monologue never gave her a moment of peace. What if they think I’m weird? Did I just say the wrong thing? Oh no, I spoke too loudly. Her every action was filtered through an unforgiving lens of self-criticism.</p><p>Seventeen minutes.</p><p>She could already hear Leah ordering a caramel macchiato in that cheerful voice of hers. Leah always had a way of bringing a positive spin to conversations—complimenting strangers on their hair, telling coworkers about the best muffins from the bakery down the street. And Sophia? Her mouth felt like it came equipped with a permanent awkward pause button. If Leah complimented her scarf, Sophia would probably mumble thanks and tug it tighter out of habit.</p><p>It wasn’t as though she’d never tried to change. College had been her first real attempt at forcing herself to step out of her comfort zone. She signed up for the Debate Society—an insane, impulsive choice for someone who could barely string together a sentence. Her first debate had been a disaster, her words tumbling out in halting stammers. Her opponent had looked at her with mild confusion, and her teammates avoided her gaze for the rest of the evening. She had quit the next day, sinking into the safety of her dorm room, where the world felt smaller, less threatening.</p><p>And yet, somewhere beneath the relentless self-doubt, a part of her still craved connection. The kind that went beyond polite courtesies or half-hearted smiles. She wanted to tell someone—anyone—what it felt like to carry this invisible burden, to navigate life as though constantly stepping through a minefield.</p><p>Ten minutes.</p><p>Her palms were damp, and she wiped them on her jeans. She hadn’t thought about what she’d say to Leah yet. “How was your weekend?” seemed like an obvious go-to, but Sophia worried she might lack the energy to fake interest long enough to sound genuine. What if Leah’s weekend had been packed with fun events and anecdotes while Sophia’s had been spent rewatching the same comfort show she always turned to when life felt overwhelming? Not that she could admit that.</p><p>She watched a group of teenagers walk past, their laughter carefree and uninhibited, the complete opposite of how she felt. To be young and unafraid—it was a privilege Sophia never learned how to claim. If only people could see past the carefully controlled mask she wore each day. It wouldn’t make sense to them, though. How do you explain a fear of exposure to people who thrive on being seen?</p><p>Five minutes.</p><p>Before she could talk herself out of it, Sophia stood up straight, adjusted her scarf, and stepped inside the café. The familiar aroma of coffee and pastries enveloped her, but she barely had a moment to take it in before a flash of blonde hair caught her eye. Leah waved from a table by the window, her face lighting up when she spotted Sophia. There it was again—that generous, effervescent smile.</p><p>“Sophia! Over here!” Leah called.</p><p>Sophia forced a small smile of her own and walked over, heels clicking against the tiles. The café felt too bright, the burn of artificial lighting too close to how her face flushed under scrutiny. But this wasn’t about lighting or coffee or even Leah. It was about the moment—the choice to sit down at this table rather than fleeing outside.</p><p>“Hey!” Leah greeted enthusiastically. “I ordered us both some cappuccinos. Hope that’s okay!”</p><p>Sophia nodded. “Yeah, perfect. Thanks.”</p><p>She sat down, glued her hands to her lap, and willed herself not to fidget. Leah launched into a story about an internship application, her words tumbling out in a wave of self-confidence. Sophia nodded along, her brain a mix of jumbled insecurities and a cautious reminder that, by being here, she was already winning a small battle.</p><p>For the first time that day, her mask didn’t feel so heavy.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/mental-health-and-psychology/>Mental Health and Psychology</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/behind-closed-doors-unmasking-depression/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Behind Closed Doors: Unmasking Depression</span>
