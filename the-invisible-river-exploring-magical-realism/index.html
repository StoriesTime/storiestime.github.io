The river, too, had disappeared, leaving only the gentle rustling of the wind in the trees. The forest was still, but I felt a deep sense of peace within me.</p><p>I made my way back to the village, my mind racing with everything I had learned. The Invisible River was not just a legend. It was a truth that had been hidden in plain sight, waiting for those brave enough to seek it.</p><p>As I entered the village, I felt the eyes of the townspeople on me. They must have noticed the change in me—an unspoken understanding that now lived within me. I had found the river, not with my eyes, but with my heart.</p><p>And so, the Invisible River remained, flowing through the world, unseen but ever-present, carrying with it the wisdom of the ages for those willing to listen.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/magical-realism/>Magical Realism</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-invisible-garden-secrets-beneath-the-surface/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Invisible Garden: Secrets Beneath the Surface</span>
