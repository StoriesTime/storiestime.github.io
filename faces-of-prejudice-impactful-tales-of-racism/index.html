She stood at the edge of the busy downtown street, feeling the pull of the world around her—people bustling by, cars honking, the quiet hum of a city that never stopped. Yet, within her, there was a constant noise, a reminder of the things she carried that weren’t visible to others. Today, like many days before it, she carried the weight of others&rsquo; assumptions about her, about the color of her skin.</p><p>Ava wasn’t used to speaking up. As a Black woman living in a predominantly white neighborhood, she’d learned to keep to herself. She’d learned that people saw her and didn’t see her. They saw a stereotype—a story they’d been told about who she was, what she was supposed to be, and it wasn’t always kind. The microaggressions, the looks, the dismissals—they had worn on her, slowly, over time. But Ava had always managed to push through. She had to.</p><p>But today was different. Something had changed inside her. Maybe it was the call from her mother earlier, reminding her of their shared history, of how far they had come together as a family, how they’d fought for a place in a world that never seemed to want them. Maybe it was the conversation she’d had with a friend last night, one that had broken open her understanding of racism—not as something distant or abstract, but as something personal, something that could no longer be ignored.</p><p>Ava turned and walked toward the coffee shop where she’d meet her colleagues. As she stepped inside, she immediately noticed the subtle shift in the atmosphere. There was a quietness when she entered, like a hush had fallen over the room. She ignored it, though, and made her way to the counter to place her order.</p><p>“Can I help you?” the barista asked, his voice just a little too cheerful.</p><p>“Just a medium black coffee, please,” Ava said, smiling politely.</p><p>The barista nodded and turned to prepare the drink, but not before giving her a brief, almost imperceptible glance. Ava felt it, though. It was that look. The one that made her feel like she was less than a person, like she was an object to be sized up and judged.</p><p>She paid for the coffee and sat at the table where her colleagues would soon arrive. As she waited, her thoughts wandered back to her childhood, to the places where racism had first touched her life, long before she could even name it.</p><hr><p>Ava grew up in a small town in the Midwest, where the Black population was sparse, and the whispers of prejudice were often louder than the voices of understanding. Her father worked as a mechanic, and her mother was a teacher, both roles that were often undervalued by the community.</p><p>At school, Ava was often the only Black face in the classroom, and though no one ever said anything overtly cruel, the microaggressions came in waves. There was the time she had been told she was “articulate for a Black girl,” as if being well-spoken was a surprise. Or when her teacher once asked her to explain “what it was like to grow up Black” in front of the class, as if her identity could be boiled down to a singular experience.</p><p>Ava had learned early that the world saw her differently than it saw her peers. She learned to navigate it quietly, to smile and nod and not cause waves. But there were days, like today, when the weight of those small, insidious moments grew too heavy to ignore.</p><p>She recalled an incident in high school when she had been applying to colleges. Her guidance counselor, a well-meaning but misguided woman named Mrs. Harper, had asked her, “Have you considered looking into historically Black colleges and universities?” The suggestion wasn’t necessarily wrong, but the assumption behind it—the idea that Ava, because of her skin color, was better suited for a place that catered to people like her—felt like a slap in the face.</p><p>“I’ve been looking into other schools, too,” Ava had replied, her voice steady, though she’d felt a fire burning in her chest.</p><p>“Of course,” Mrs. Harper had said, a touch too quickly, as if trying to backpedal. But the damage had been done. Ava had felt, for the first time, the invisible walls that people built around her simply because of how she looked.</p><hr><p>Back in the coffee shop, Ava shook off the memory and looked out the window as the street continued to bustle outside. The door opened, and her colleagues entered. She stood and waved them over, trying to shake off the discomfort that had begun to settle in her chest.</p><p>They were well-meaning people, friends who didn’t understand what she went through. Their conversations often swirled around issues of race, but from a distance, like something academic or theoretical. To them, it was something they read about in the news, not something that lived inside someone they cared about.</p><p>“Hey, Ava!” Tom, one of her colleagues, greeted her as they approached the table.</p><p>“Hey,” Ava said, trying to smile.</p><p>“So, I saw this thing online yesterday,” Tom continued, setting his coffee down. “It’s about how racism isn’t as bad anymore, you know? Like, people are just too sensitive these days.”</p><p>Ava froze. She knew this conversation. She had heard it before. It was the same conversation that had been circling in her mind for days now. The idea that racism was over, that people were just playing the victim, that it was all in the past.</p><p>“Yeah,” Ava said, her voice quieter than she intended. “I’ve heard that too.”</p><p>“It’s like, how much longer are we going to keep talking about it?” Tom said. “We’ve had the Civil Rights movement, right? Doesn’t that mean we should all be moving on by now?”</p><p>Ava felt the familiar sting of frustration welling up inside her. She wanted to say something, something that would make him understand. But she knew it wouldn’t work. She’d tried before. The truth was, racism wasn’t something that was ever “over.” It was something that morphed, shifted, and found new ways to infect society. It was in the way people still crossed the street when they saw her walking toward them. It was in the way she had to work twice as hard to be taken seriously in meetings. It was in the way the world sometimes treated her as though she were less than.</p><p>But Ava didn’t respond immediately. Instead, she took a deep breath, trying to keep her composure.</p><p>“I think racism is more complicated than that,” she said finally. “It’s not just about big events or speeches or laws. It’s in the everyday things—the things we might not even notice. The assumptions we make, the way we talk about people who aren’t like us.”</p><p>Tom frowned, his brow furrowed in confusion. “I don’t get it. What do you mean?”</p><p>Ava paused, choosing her words carefully. “It’s like this,” she said. “Imagine, every day, you walk into a room and you know that people are seeing you as something less than you are. Not because of anything you’ve done, but because of the color of your skin. You try to tell them who you are, but they’ve already made up their minds. And that’s the thing—you don’t always get to prove them wrong. They won’t listen.”</p><p>There was silence at the table for a moment as the words hung in the air. Tom looked like he wanted to respond, but he didn’t. Ava could see the wheels turning in his head, but he didn’t have the words to fully understand.</p><p>“It’s exhausting,” Ava continued. “But you can’t just stop fighting. You can’t just pretend it’s not happening, because it is. Every day, in big ways and small.”</p><p>Her colleagues didn’t know how to respond, and the conversation shifted to other topics. But Ava could feel the disconnect, the unspoken understanding that they would never truly know her experience. And that was okay. It wasn’t her job to make them understand. It was her job to keep pushing, to keep fighting, to keep showing up.</p><p>As she finished her coffee and stood to leave, Ava realized that the weight she carried wasn’t one that could be shrugged off easily. It was part of her, but it didn’t define her. She would continue to fight the battle, not just for herself, but for everyone who had ever been made to feel less than because of their race, their ethnicity, their identity.</p><p>As she walked out of the coffee shop and back into the world, she felt a sense of resolve settle over her. She would keep her head up, keep moving forward. Because the fight wasn’t over. It was ongoing, every day, in the faces of prejudice she encountered and in the small acts of resistance she carried with her.</p><p>And that, she knew, was the beginning of change.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/racism-and-prejudice/>Racism and Prejudice</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/faces-of-discrimination-short-stories-confronting-racism/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Faces of Discrimination: Short Stories Confronting Racism</span>
