Its light filtered through the cracks in the blinds of the small apartment, casting long shadows on the walls. Jamil stood by the window, looking out at the busy street below. His fingers rested lightly on the sill, the coolness of the wood offering a brief respite from the heat that had settled in the air. The street was familiar, yet today it seemed different. Today, everything felt a little more distant, a little more foreign.</p><p>Jamil had lived here for as long as he could remember. The same street, the same faces—except for the ones that had started to change. The ones who had started to look at him differently. The ones who no longer greeted him with the same warmth. The ones who had begun to see him, not for who he was, but for the color of his skin.</p><p>He could feel the weight of it, the subtle shifts in the air when he walked into a room. The way people paused, just for a second too long, as if unsure of whether to smile or nod. The way some seemed to cross the street when they saw him coming, as though his mere presence was a threat.</p><p>It had started small. An offhand comment here, a dismissive glance there. But over time, it had built up—a quiet, insidious force that had begun to shape his world. It was the way they looked at him, the way they treated him, and sometimes, the way they ignored him altogether. He was no longer just Jamil; he was &ldquo;the other,&rdquo; an outsider, a stereotype, a symbol of something they feared or despised.</p><p>And Jamil hated it. He hated the way the world seemed to label him based on something he had no control over. He hated the way people seemed to forget that he was more than just his skin color. He was a person with hopes, dreams, and desires just like anyone else, but none of that mattered. All that mattered was the color of his skin.</p><p>One afternoon, Jamil found himself walking down the street to the small corner store, his steps heavy with frustration. He had seen the way people turned away when he passed, how their eyes darted nervously in his direction. It was as if they were afraid, as if he was some kind of monster lurking in their midst. He had tried to brush it off, to tell himself that it was just his imagination, but deep down, he knew it wasn’t. It was real.</p><p>As he entered the store, the bell above the door jingled, and the air inside felt cooler. The store was small, cramped even, with shelves crammed full of everyday necessities. The woman behind the counter, Mrs. Whitaker, looked up from her magazine as Jamil walked in. Her smile faltered for just a second before she quickly composed herself.</p><p>&ldquo;Good afternoon, Jamil,&rdquo; she said, her voice a little too cheerful, a little too forced.</p><p>&ldquo;Afternoon, Mrs. Whitaker,&rdquo; Jamil replied, his tone polite but distant.</p><p>He walked down the aisles, his eyes scanning the shelves, but he couldn’t shake the feeling that Mrs. Whitaker was watching him. He could feel her eyes on him, following his every move. It wasn’t the warm, welcoming gaze he had grown up with; it was something else. Something colder, more suspicious.</p><p>As he reached for a can of beans on the top shelf, he noticed a man standing at the end of the aisle, his eyes locked on Jamil. The man didn’t smile. Didn’t nod in greeting. He just stared, his gaze narrow, his lips pressed into a thin line. Jamil’s heart skipped a beat, but he forced himself to remain calm. He grabbed the can and turned to head toward the counter, but the man didn’t move. He stood there, blocking the aisle, as if daring Jamil to ask him to move.</p><p>Jamil hesitated, his mind racing. Was this just another one of those subtle signs? Was this man afraid of him? Was he prejudiced?</p><p>He took a deep breath, his fingers tightening around the can. “Excuse me,” he said, his voice steady but not without tension.</p><p>The man didn’t respond at first, but after a long, uncomfortable pause, he stepped aside, mumbling something unintelligible under his breath. Jamil walked past him, keeping his head high, but his mind was a whirlwind. Was this just a coincidence? Or was this what it felt like to be seen through the eyes of prejudice?</p><p>When Jamil reached the counter, Mrs. Whitaker took his items without meeting his gaze. She was quick, almost too quick, as if eager to finish the transaction and send him on his way.</p><p>&ldquo;Here you go,&rdquo; she said, her voice now cold, distant.</p><p>Jamil nodded and took the bag. He didn’t want to make a scene, didn’t want to draw any more attention to himself, so he paid and left without another word. But as he stepped out into the street, the weight of it all settled over him like a heavy cloud. This wasn’t just about one person or one encounter. It was everywhere. It was in the way people looked at him, the way they spoke to him, the way they treated him like he didn’t belong.</p><p>And the worst part? He couldn’t figure out why. Why was it that people saw him and immediately thought the worst? Why was it that his skin was enough to make people fear him, to make them treat him like he was different, like he didn’t deserve the same respect as everyone else?</p><p>As Jamil walked home, his thoughts swirled in a tangled mess. He had always known that racism existed. He had heard the stories, seen the news reports, but to experience it firsthand was something entirely different. It wasn’t just the big, overt acts of hate—no, it was the small things. The way people avoided eye contact, the way they spoke around him as if he wasn’t even there, the way they assumed things about him before they even knew his name.</p><p>It was exhausting, to be constantly judged, to be constantly aware of how others saw him. But what hurt the most was the realization that it wasn’t going to change anytime soon. Racism was deeply embedded in society, a festering wound that had been left untreated for far too long.</p><p>And yet, Jamil wasn’t ready to give up. He wasn’t ready to let the prejudice of others define him. He knew that he couldn’t change everyone’s mind, but he could change his own perspective. He could choose not to let the actions of others dictate how he saw himself. He could choose to keep walking, to keep pushing forward, despite the hatred and ignorance that surrounded him.</p><p>That night, as he lay in bed staring at the ceiling, he thought about the way people treated him. He thought about the way they saw him, not as a person, but as a symbol. A symbol of fear, a symbol of difference. But Jamil knew that wasn’t who he was. He wasn’t a symbol. He was a person. He was Jamil.</p><p>And that was enough.</p><p>In the days that followed, Jamil began to see things differently. He began to see the subtle ways in which racism crept into everyday life, the way it shaped interactions and conversations. But he also began to see the small acts of kindness, the quiet moments where people looked past his skin and saw him for who he truly was.</p><p>It wasn’t much, but it was enough. Enough to remind him that not everyone saw him through the eyes of prejudice. And for the first time in a long while, Jamil felt a flicker of hope.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/racism-and-prejudice/>Racism and Prejudice</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/through-the-eyes-of-prejudice-a-journey-of-understanding/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Through the Eyes of Prejudice: A Journey of Understanding</span>
