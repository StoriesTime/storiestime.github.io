It was the same rhythm that had carried Rania across three countries, yet here, on the outskirts of a city whose name she still struggled to pronounce, she felt its trembling pulse in her bones for the first time. She stared through the soot-streaked window as the horizon split itself into jagged steel and cement. The skyline rose like a monolith of shadow and light.</p><p>Rania clutched the tiny leather wallet in her pocket, the contents of which had guided her from the small fishing village she used to call home—a community that once thrived on salt-stained winds and morning hauls—to this unknown urban sprawl. All that remained of her old life fit into the folds of that wallet: her father&rsquo;s faded ID card, her mother&rsquo;s lucky prayer beads, and a printed photograph of herself taken three years ago, back when laughter still came easily. She no longer looked like the girl in the picture.</p><p>The train slowed to a groaning halt at the terminal, and the chatter of passengers filled the air. Strangers streamed past Rania in waves, their expressions flat, their movements brisk. Some carried colorful plastic bags stuffed with goods, others dragged luggage that rattled over the uneven floor. She took a shallow breath and joined them, the scent of diesel and warm bread mingling with the brisk air inside the terminal.</p><p>Every movement forward felt heavy, as though her feet were reluctant soldiers marching toward a foreign battlefield. Yet she pressed on, emerging onto the platform where the cold air of the city slapped her cheeks like an unkind greeting. The scale of everything was disorienting—the ceaseless movement of bodies, the towering architecture pressing in from all sides, the neon lights that blinked and buzzed in fluorescent defiance of the darkening sky.</p><p>The city promised new beginnings, or so the pamphlet she had been handed weeks earlier had advertised. “Global Horizons,” the words proclaimed. The organization had airbrushed images of diverse families gathered at tables, smiling over steaming plates of food. “A home for everyone, anywhere.” Rania knew better than to trust glossy pictures. What the pamphlet had failed to mention were the ghosts you carried with you, the creeping doubt that whispered you didn’t belong in either the place you had left or the place you arrived.</p><p>Her first night in the city was spent huddled in a sparse communal shelter with twenty other recent arrivals, each one quieter than the next. There was Farid, who had crossed three continents, a calloused hand permanently glued to the duffel bag that contained his only possessions. There was a young man named Emil who spoke to no one, his sharp eyes darting like a bird&rsquo;s, always searching for an exit. And then there was Mariam, an elderly woman who braided her hair with trembling hands beneath the dim orange glow of a single bulb. Rania wondered what stories they carried locked in their chests, what sights had seared themselves into their memory that they now worked to suppress.</p><p>Sleep eluded her. Instead, she traced the outline of her mother’s beads in the dark. She imagined her home, not as it had been when she left—ravaged by uncertainty—but the way it existed in her childhood. Nights lit by oil lamps and the hum of cicadas. The sea breeze carrying the aroma of fresh fish as her father mended nets—or sang, if he thought no one was listening. That life felt impossibly distant, a relic buried beneath the rubble of passing years.</p><p>The first morning came too soon, dragging her forward into the monotony of what all newcomers were expected to endure. Hours spent in overheated government offices, completing forms in a language she barely understood. Procedures that felt as distant and impersonal as the city itself. The officials spoke quickly, each instruction a command echoing through the fog of bureaucracy. “Next. Sign here. Date here.”</p><p>Rania’s caseworker, a tall man with glasses that slid down his nose, offered her dry reassurances. “It’s good here,” he told her, without looking up from his screen. “Lots of work, good community programs, safe neighborhoods. You’ll adjust.”</p><p>Adjust. The word felt like a sharp-edged stone in her mouth. As if it were that simple—to take the jagged pieces of her past, shove them into a glossy mold of her future, and hope they fit.</p><p>Work came sooner than she expected. Night shifts in a bakery downtown, long hours kneading dough until her forearms ached and her fingertips were raw. She was grateful for the distraction. The rhythmic nature of baking—a formula repeated, a structure followed—offered her a fragile semblance of control. But evenings were the hardest. After the bakery closed, after the clatter of pans and rush of customers dwindled into silence, she walked home through streets that whispered of lives she did not yet understand. The city pulsed around her, alive with stories she was not yet part of. Groups of friends spilled out of cafés. Families gathered in bustling markets. She could barely tell one intersection from another, her only landmarks the street numbers stamped on the metal signs at each corner.</p><p>One night, on her way back to the shelter, she crossed paths with Aarik. He was older, perhaps in his fifties, with silver streaking the sides of his close-cropped hair. He healed bicycles out of a cramped workshop that smelled of grease and worn rubber. She first saw him crouched over a rusted chain, his hands deftly working as though they carried an unspoken language all their own. He looked up as her shoes scraped the pavement in her attempt to pass silently.</p><p>“You’re not from here,” he said without judgment, wiping his hands on a rag. His voice was steady, firm, but not unkind.</p><p>She paused, unsure if he was speaking to her. “No,” she answered anyway.</p><p>His lips quirked into a faint smile. “Neither am I.”</p><p>That small admission turned into a conversation that stretched across weeks. Aarik had come to the city decades earlier, his broken homeland left behind like many others who passed through. He didn’t ask her story directly, respecting the protective silence she wrapped herself in. But he offered his own anecdotes in fragments—a journey crammed in the back of trucks, years spent repairing machinery with borrowed tools, friends who disappeared like smoke. From him, Rania learned the art of repair: broken bike chains, punctured tires, gears that refused to turn. He spoke of how cities like theirs devoured people whole but could sometimes spit them back out stronger.</p><p>“Everything corrodes,” he told her one cold night as she watched him disassemble a wheel in the dimly-lit shop. “Everything breaks. But not everything is lost. The pieces are still there, waiting to be put back together.”</p><p>The city did not grow kinder overnight, but it started to grow familiar. Her fingers learned the pathways of its streets. Her feet moved with a confidence she had never known they could possess. Slowly, the words and customs of this new place seeped into her being, not replacing what she was, but layering over it like sediment over a restless riverbed.</p><p>Months passed, seasons shifted. She rejected nothing of her past but accepted everything the future placed in her hands. She befriended Mariam, whose braided hair she now helped tie when her hands were too stiff. She shared a fleeting smile with Emil one afternoon as they passed each other on the street. She still worked in the bakery, saving what she could, yet she found herself returning to Aarik’s workshop even after her long shifts, craving not just the comfort of his company but the small rebellions they waged against broken things.</p><p>On the eve of her one-year anniversary in the city, Rania stood at the bridge overlooking the waterfront. It was the closest she had come to the sea since leaving home. The water shimmered under streetlights, reflecting the geometric chaos of the skyline. A seagull screeched somewhere in the distance, a sound so familiar and foreign all at once that it made her chest ache. She reached into her pocket and pulled out her mother&rsquo;s prayer beads, running them through her fingers as the familiar words of a blessing she had forgotten echoed faintly in her memory.</p><p>And for the first time since leaving her village, she allowed herself to weep—not from despair or loneliness, but for the convergence of everything she had lost and everything she had begun to find.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/migration-and-immigration/>Migration and Immigration</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/dreams-in-transit-short-stories-on-immigration/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Dreams in Transit: Short Stories on Immigration</span>
