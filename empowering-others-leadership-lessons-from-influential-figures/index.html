Among the attendees sat a mix of students, aspiring entrepreneurs, educators, and established professionals. They had gathered to hear a talk from one of the world’s most respected leadership coaches, Margaret Hayes—a woman whose career wasn’t just a study in success but a testament to the power of empowering others.</p><p>As Margaret stepped onto the stage, her presence commanded immediate attention. There was nothing particularly imposing about her demeanor, but her warmth and resolve filled the space. She began without preamble, her voice steady yet full of conviction.</p><h3 id=the-story-of-george>The Story of George</h3><p>Margaret leaned forward slightly, her eyes sweeping across the audience. &ldquo;I want to begin with a story,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It’s about a man most of you probably wouldn’t know. His name was George Wilkinson, and he was the janitor at my very first job.&rdquo;</p><p>The audience shifted slightly, some intrigued, others puzzled.</p><p>Margaret continued, &ldquo;George had been with the company for over twenty years by the time I joined fresh out of college, thinking I could take over the world in six months. It didn’t take long for me to realize that my degree and ambition weren’t enough to navigate the challenges of the real world. That’s when George stepped in.&rdquo;</p><p>She paused for effect, letting her words settle. &ldquo;George didn’t have a corner office or an MBA, but he had something even more important: wisdom and the ability to see people—not as they were but as they could be. One day, after a particularly rough meeting with my manager, I found myself venting in frustration near the breakroom. George, quietly mopping the floor as always, stopped and said something I’ll never forget: &lsquo;The loudest voice in the room isn’t always the strongest, but the one that lifts others will always last the longest.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>The audience was silent, hanging on her every word. Margaret leaned back, a small smile playing on her lips. &ldquo;That day, George not only empowered me to approach leadership differently but showed me that the most influential leaders aren’t necessarily the ones at the top—they’re often the ones who see potential in others and help nurture it.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=a-leader-reborn>A Leader Reborn</h3><p>Margaret went on to recount her journey. She spoke of how she adopted George’s philosophy in her own work as she climbed the corporate ladder, going from a junior marketing associate to the vice president of a multinational corporation. However, through each milestone, she always made time to ask herself one question: &ldquo;Whose voice have I lifted today?&rdquo;</p><p>There was the intern struggling with imposter syndrome whom she encouraged to present their ideas in a high-stakes meeting. That intern later went on to become one of the youngest department heads in the company’s history. Then there was her assistant, who dreamed of writing a novel but never seemed to believe in her own story. By nudging her to set aside time daily for her writing and sharing her work with others, Margaret watched as that assistant eventually published a book that climbed to the bestseller list.</p><p>She didn’t share these anecdotes to boast—far from it. Margaret shared these stories because they exemplified her deeper point: leadership wasn’t about titles or prestige. True leadership was about lifting others and setting the stage for them to succeed.</p><p>The ripple effect of empowering even a single individual, she explained, was profound. Each act of lifting someone up created a domino effect, inspiring that person to empower others in turn. This not only built stronger teams and communities but created a legacy far deeper and more enduring than any personal accomplishments could.</p><h3 id=lessons-from-renowned-figures>Lessons from Renowned Figures</h3><p>To further illustrate her philosophy, Margaret pulled from the lives of influential leaders throughout history.</p><p>She spoke of Eleanor Roosevelt, whose empathetic leadership style transformed her into one of the most powerful First Ladies in history. Roosevelt’s ability to champion human rights wasn’t born out of a lust for power. It came from her deep-seated belief in the potential of every person to rise when given the right support. She didn’t seek to dominate conversations but instead brought others into the fold, asking questions, listening, and acting as a catalyst for change.</p><p>Margaret also highlighted Nelson Mandela’s extraordinary legacy. Despite enduring 27 years of imprisonment, Mandela emerged with an unshakable resolve to heal and unite a fractured nation. &ldquo;He didn’t lead by dictating from a pedestal,&rdquo; she explained, &ldquo;but by moving among the people, understanding their pain, and empowering them to embrace forgiveness and transformation.&rdquo;</p><p>Then, she moved on to modern examples, including Malala Yousafzai, whose courage to stand up for education has inspired millions. Malala’s leadership, Margaret emphasized, wasn’t about securing a position of authority but about amplifying the voices of those who had been silenced and fighting for the right to education for every child.</p><p>&ldquo;These examples,&rdquo; Margaret concluded, &ldquo;show us that empowering others is a universal thread in great leadership. It’s not about the scale of your platform or resources—it’s about your willingness to light the way for someone else and help them see their own potential.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=lessons-for-the-audience>Lessons for the Audience</h3><p>By the time Margaret’s talk neared its conclusion, pens were furiously scribbling, and heads were nodding in agreement. But Margaret wasn’t interested in leaving her audience with lofty ideals alone; she wanted them to take actionable steps.</p><p>&ldquo;If there’s one thing you remember from today,&rdquo; Margaret said, her tone firm yet encouraging, &ldquo;let it be this: you don’t have to wait for permission or a job title to empower others. Start where you are. Look around at your colleagues, your friends, and even your family. Who can you encourage today? Whose strengths can you magnify? Whose load can you help lighten?&rdquo;</p><p>She went on to outline a few practical strategies.</p><p>&ldquo;First,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;practice active listening. Truly hearing someone—without interrupting or trying to solve their problems instantly—is one of the simplest ways to empower them. People feel valued when they know their voice matters.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Second, share opportunities. If you’re in a position of privilege, use it to open doors for others. Recommend someone for a project, introduce them to a mentor, or suggest their name for a leadership position.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And lastly,&rdquo; Margaret said, her gaze sweeping the room again, &ldquo;lead with empathy. When you take the time to understand others’ struggles and aspirations, you can guide them more effectively. Empathy is a bridge—it connects us to others and reminds us that leadership is as much about serving as it is about guiding.&rdquo;</p><p>Her final words were simple but resonant: &ldquo;Leadership isn’t about being in charge—it’s about taking care of those in your charge. Be the kind of leader who lifts others toward the light, and you’ll find your own legacy shining brighter than ever.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=walking-away-transformed>Walking Away Transformed</h3><p>As the crowd filed out of the lecture hall, the energy in the air was palpable. Strangers struck up conversations about the times someone had empowered them and how they hoped to do the same for others. A young woman in the third row shared how her mentor had given her the courage to start her own company. A professor in the back corner reflected on how he could better foster his students’ expanding potential.</p><p>Margaret stood near the stage, shaking hands and exchanging warm smiles with attendees. Her words had landed in fertile ground, nurturing seeds of inspiration that would sprout and grow far beyond that room.</p><p>In the end, it wasn’t Margaret’s achievements or accolades that made her a great leader. It was the fact that she understood one truth: the most lasting impact any leader can have is empowering others to carry the torch forward, leaving the world a little brighter for those who follow.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/leadership-and-influence/>Leadership and Influence</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/empathy-in-leadership-unlocking-the-power-of-connection/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Empathy in Leadership: Unlocking the Power of Connection</span>
