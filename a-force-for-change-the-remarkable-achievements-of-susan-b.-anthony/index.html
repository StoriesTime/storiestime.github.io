Anthony</h1><div class=post-description></div></header><figure class=entry-cover><img loading=eager src=https://stories.googlexy.com/images/historical-figures.jpeg alt></figure><br><div class=post-content><p>Susan B. Anthony never imagined that her unquenchable spirit and steadfast determination would lead to profound social change. She was simply a young woman with a burning desire for education, boundless curiosity, and a sense of justice. Despite her humble beginnings, she would leave an indelible mark in American history, advocating for the entire lives of women.</p><h2 id=an-unconventional-beginning>An Unconventional Beginning</h2><p>Born on February 15, 1820, in Advertiser, New York, she was the fourth of five children. Raised in a Quaker household, Anthony received an education uncommon for her time, attending boarding schools manned by Quakers. But despite her advantageous education, Anthony wouldn&rsquo;t find remarkable success in the expected norms of 19th-century society.</p><p>Anthony&rsquo;s frustrations began early. Her first job was as a teacher at just 14 years old, and even with her Quaker training, she faced constant rebukes for her beliefs and manners. She was barred from talking openly in class and had to constantly tippy-toe around the expectations of her male colleagues.</p><h2 id=a-passion-for-justice>A Passion for Justice</h2><p>Anthony&rsquo;s search for justice began when she was in college. She was appalled by the glaring inequities between men and women under the law. When she graduated from higher education, she decided to dedicate her life to righting these wrongs.</p><p>Susan B. Anthony visited women in jails, learning about their legal rights while incarcerated. Anthony discovered that women were denied the rights afforded to men. This was a bitter pill to swallow.</p><p>Anthony soon networked with women activists like Elizabeth Cady Stanton, believing that this was a collaboration where their collective efforts would be most impactful. However, she did encounter resistance, primarily from men, who rejected her pleas for change. So, Anthony and Stanton launched their own newspaper, <em>The Women&rsquo;s Tribune</em>, to garner public support for equal rights between men and women.</p><h2 id=the-civil-war>The Civil War</h2><p>The Civil War provided a crucial turning point in Anthony&rsquo;s life. As she worked alongside the soldiers, she saw extraordinary women nurses, cooks, and mechanics. It was then she realized that the same acts men were allowed to do, women were fully capable of executing.</p><p>After the war, Anthony helped found the American Anti-Slavery Society and the Women&rsquo;s National Loyal League, advocating for the abolition of slavery and the granting of suffrage.</p><p>But Anthony and Stanton faced a conundrum: the Fourteenth Amendment granted citizenship to former slaves, but didn&rsquo;t extend that citizenship to women. Anthony took this issue to Congress, arguing that justice had again failed half of humanity.</p><p>The resulting debate was robust and intense. Despite Anthony&rsquo;s attempts, her arguments were rejected. She wasn&rsquo;t discouraged, however. Anthony persisted through petitions, demonstrations, and more examination of the Constitution. Eventually, the argument wended its way to the Supreme Court, but without Anthony&rsquo;s desired outcome.</p><h2 id=a-personal-sacrifice>A Personal Sacrifice</h2><p>Anthony&rsquo;s continued struggles took a personal toll. She went broke funding their newspaper, was ostracized by society, and her family life suffered. When her sister died and left her a substantial inheritance, Anthony took that money and poured it into her work.</p><h2 id=victory-and-legacy>Victory and Legacy</h2><p>Finally, the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was passed on August 18, 1920, granting women the right to vote. The hero of this battle is Susan B. Anthony, whose relentless efforts never waned.</p><p>However, Anthony never got to see the fruit of her labors. She passed away on March 13, 1906, at the age of 86. Still, her legacy lives on: with her relentless courage, she paved the way for a quarter of the population to have an equal say in their nations&rsquo; future. As a driving force for change, Susan B. Anthony forever altered the course of American history.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/historical-figures/>Historical Figures</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/a-duel-with-destiny-alexander-hamiltons-final-hours/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>A Duel with Destiny: Alexander Hamilton's Final Hours</span>
