It pattered softly, each drop tapping an uneven beat like a clock ticking out of sync with the world. Victor blinked sleep from his eyes and stared at his own reflection in the wavery glass, wondering if today—by some perverse decree of fate—would actually be different.</p><p>He never expected the letter. The one with his name across the envelope in that angular print, the one that shifted his reality the way tectonic plates grind and shudder out mountains.</p><p>It arrived with the post: a thick envelope, a wax seal pressed deep into the paper, and a scent of something unfamiliar—ozone after a thunderstorm. The address simply read “Victor Hart, 4D, Alder Street,” but the return was scribed in looping characters he didn&rsquo;t recognize: <em>Parallel Transit Authority</em>.</p><p>Curiosity pried open the seal. Inside, not paper as he’d expected, but a thin luminescent slate flickering with shifting patterns. Light shot out, flooding Victor’s bedroom with static warmth.</p><p>Then the disembodied voice: <em>Welcome, Victor. This is your invitation to the Transit.</em></p><p>&ldquo;Transit?&rdquo;</p><p>His voice sounded small and strange in the empty room.</p><p><em>You have been selected to participate in a trial of parallel causality transit. You are eligible for a visit along your own timeline—a chance to alter, observe, or meet the other selves that coexist across adjacent branches.</em></p><p>The slate pulsed, a spectral pulse. He heard his own breathing, fast and nervous, as the options scrolled before him:</p><ol><li><em>Observe Past Self.</em></li><li><em>Meet Alternate Self.</em></li><li><em>Alter a Pivotal Choice.</em></li><li><em>Return to Present.</em></li></ol><p>Victor hesitated for half a moment before finger-brushing ‘Meet Alternate Self.’</p><p>A hum pitched behind his ears. The world fell away.</p><hr><p>He awoke in a city almost like—not quite—his own. The skyline was different, edged with violet glass and shimmering with what looked like energy fields, not smog. Trees sprouted through buildings rather than lining the avenue. In this place, pedestrians hovered half a foot above the ground, their feet skimming an unseen surface.</p><p>Staring at his own reflection in a burnished elevator panel, he saw the first difference: his hair longer, streaked silver at the temples, and confidence in the stance—a figure solid and certain, where Victor always felt transparent.</p><p>He barely had time to process before the elevator opened to an apartment, a mirror of his own, but suffused with artifacts and symbols of a different life. Books—hundreds of them—spilled across every spare surface, battered volumes with titles he recognized but never read.</p><p>“Hello,” said the man at the window. He didn’t turn right away.</p><p>Victor stepped forward. “I don’t suppose you’re expecting me.”</p><p>Alternate Victor turned slowly and grinned. “I always hoped I’d get the chance. You’re from&mldr; early in the chain, aren’t you?”</p><p>It took a breath for Victor to find his voice. “I chose to meet an alternate self. I guess that’s you.”</p><p>The other Victor—a little older, a touch sharper—walked to the book-laden table. He waved in a way both casual and deadly earnest. “Coffee?”</p><p>Victor grinned despite himself. “Sure. I have about a dozen questions.”</p><p>Pouring from a steaming pot, the other Victor said, “So, which life are you from? The one where you became a linguist, or the one where you caved in and took up actuarial science?”</p><p>Victor let out a laugh, involuntary and bright. “Actuarial. God, is it that obvious?”</p><p>“Numbers hang on your shoulders like a winter coat. I took the other road.” Alternate Victor handed over the mug. “And, you know, I never thought time travel would work. Guess I have you for company now.”</p><p>They sat. They talked—about mothers still living, or dead; about first loves kept, or lost; about the insistent ache that things could be different and what that did to a person.</p><p>As rain flickered from this world&rsquo;s magenta clouds, Victor wondered, “Have you ever wondered what would happen if you had changed the <em>big</em> thing?”</p><p>Other Victor smiled sadly. “Every day. But here’s the thing—we’re echoes, you and me, and every decision we make scatters new versions out like children lost in the woods. Visit one. Visit a thousand. But you can’t stitch them together.”</p><p>Victor shook his head. “But if I knew, if I really knew what might have been&mldr; maybe it would help.”</p><p>His older self shrugged, sipped. “Maybe it would. But would you want to be someone else? Or do you just want <em>not</em> to regret?”</p><p>Lightning forked, distant but sharp. The apartment shimmered at its edges, as if the fabric of this world strained to hold itself together. Victor felt an urgency thrumming in his bones: time, even here, was finite.</p><hr><p>When the portal shimmered again, Victor pressed his hand to the slate and chose: <em>Alter a Pivotal Choice</em>. The options spilled before him: breaks in the river of his past, each tagged with memories.</p><ol><li>Not speaking to his father after the argument.</li><li>Accepting—or rejecting—the scholarship to the faraway university.</li><li>Calling, or not calling, Clara on that night in October—his only love.</li></ol><p>Victor’s throat closed. It had always been Clara. Her laughter, the way she lounged against his door-frame, too mischievous for suburban monotony. He’d been so afraid of loss, he never let himself reach for what he wanted.</p><p>He selected the date—October 14, ten years back.</p><hr><p>The device wafted him to that night—a boarding house, the smell of burnt coffee, and his own nervous hands twisting the phone cord.</p><p>He watched, unseen by those in the room, as Past Victor paced and rehearsed. “Just tell her. Just do it.”</p><p>The memory broke open behind his eyes: he didn’t call. He convinced himself the universe would assemble itself where it belonged. Past Victor put the phone down, slumped, and played a record instead. Futures, unwritten, drifted out of reach.</p><p>But now, unseen and untouchable, Victor screamed: “Call her! Just once!”</p><p>The slate pulsed. It offered: <em>Intervene Y/N?</em>.</p><p>God—was this what agency felt like?</p><p>He jabbed ‘Y.’</p><hr><p>Suddenly, the cord was in his hand.</p><p>He dialed. Ring. Ring.</p><p>Clara answered, her voice light. “Vic?”</p><p>The air filled with all the unsaid things that make a life unravel or stitch together again.</p><p>This time, he told her. Everything—fear, hope, the ache that stretched into years. For a fragile moment, the world trembled between what was and what could be.</p><p>Clara wept. He wept back, and in the time it takes a conversation to end, a thousand parallel lives bloomed and died, most of them invisible.</p><hr><p>He woke—again—in his own bed, morning gray curling around the edges of the curtains. His phone buzzed.</p><p><em>New message from Clara.</em></p><p>“Hey, you. Want to get coffee?”</p><p>Victor stared. The ache of ten years loosened its grip—just a little—and he understood, in a way he never had, that time wasn’t a straight line. It was a chorus, a tangled weave of possibilities, harmonics thrumming across parallel worlds.</p><p>He slid from bed, pressed his feet to the cold floor, and laughed, not because everything was fixed or perfect, but because timelines don’t mend; they multiply.</p><p>And every day after that, Victor lived twice: once for himself, and once for every mirror-self brave enough to reach out for something more.</p><hr><p><em>In every branch, in every could-have-been, Victor carried the memory of the world he left behind. Time travel changes everything, but it never changes what it means to be alive: regret, hope, and the reckless, necessary risk of reaching out—again and again, until you find the reality worth living for.</em></p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/time-travel-and-alternate-realities/>Time Travel and Alternate Realities</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/parallel-horizons-shifting-across-time-and-space/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Parallel Horizons: Shifting Across Time and Space</span>
