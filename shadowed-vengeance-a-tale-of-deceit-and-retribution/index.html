As the shrouded smog filled the air, Cedric stood in the outskirts of a bustling city tucked behind a ramshackle building, peering surreptitiously at the opulent mansion that had once been his home. His kingdom now lay in the hands of his treacherous brother, Roderick, who had stolen it all by coups and deceit.</p><p>According to the whispers, Roderick lived in the lap of luxury, revelling in the riches that rightfully belonged to Cedric. Distraught, Cedric had retreated into the shadows, living off the grid and plotting his return to reclaim his birthright. The smell of roses from the nearby garden wafted through the air, reclaiming the development of his plan - a plan for vengeance.</p><p>Amping his endurance, Cedric crouched beside the wall, brushing away a tendril of gray hair that had escaped from his hood as the sky darkened further. A soldier gonnaired by, barely giving Cedric a glance. Warily, he disappeared around the corner.</p><p>The sun dipped beneath the horizon, the shadows of the night looming closer. Cedric knew that his chance for vengeance would come as nightfall fell upon the city. It was the perfect time to execute his plans of retribution.</p><p>He crept towards the back door cautiously as the slender moon peeked from the blanket of clouds. Drawing attention to himself, he hoped to avoid it. Though silent, the hinges of the old door creaked in protest as he gently opened it. He slipped inside, aiming for the dimly lit portrait hallway housing his brother&rsquo;s treacherous visage.</p><p>Midway through his meticulously planned juncture, his eyes widened as he realized his brother wasn&rsquo;t alone. Unbeknownst to Cedric, Roderick was hosting an extravagant banquet - a nightly tradition. Cedric&rsquo;s plans went awry as he eyed the suspicious movements of armed guards prowling the dimly lit hallway.</p><p>Being the crafty strategist that he was, Cedric devised a new plan. The humongous chandelier above seemed troublesome. With the addition of his deceptive tactics, he fiddled with its wires, allowing the overheard lights to plunge into darkness.</p><p>Shadows emerged, providing the perfect cover for Cedric to undertake his stealthy strive. Swiftly, he dispatched the shocked guards lurking behind a pole, their life snuffed out unceremoniously by the shadow warrior.</p><p>A chorus of gasps echoed throughout the banquet hall as the guests discovered they were no longer guests of Roderick, but captives of his brother&rsquo;svengeance. Brandishing his sword, Cedric lunged towards the now terrified Roderick effacing imaginary blows.</p><p>Roderick, with his lackey of swordsman, fought fiercely, aiming to protect his usurped kingdom. The clang of clashing swords filled the air as both brothers clashed in a titanic struggle between blood and betrayal.</p><p>As sweat dripped down Cedric&rsquo;s face, a wicked smiled twisted his lips. Roderick, on the other hand, could do nothing but gaze sheepishly at the victory of his brother that had eluded his grasp so long.</p><p>Vengeance had taken its toll on Cedric. That single battle had drained his energy, leaving him vulnerable to his brother&rsquo;s onslaughts. In the shadows, Roderick&rsquo;s men crept closer, ever so ominously. Cedric could feel their proximity, their perceived vengefulness.</p><p>However, even as the air tightened around him, Cedric knew that he had sown the seeds of vengeance, and now reaped its <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitter>bitter taste</a>. In his fury-driven quest for retribution, he had cast himself into the same pit he despised.</p><p>Cedric realized the emptiness of his victory. The feeling of vengeance brought equal toh with them. Yet, as the night came to an end, he couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to let Roderick and his men bury his body unscathed. And so, he unsheathed his sword one final time, bearing down with all his might, piercing Roderick&rsquo;s armor and drawing first blood. The brothers embraced, their sign of love and loathe woven together within that moment of sweet, hollow vengeance.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/betrayal-and-revenge/>Betrayal and Revenge</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/shadowed-secrets-an-unrelenting-journey-through-betrayal-and-retaliation/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Shadowed Secrets: An Unrelenting Journey Through Betrayal and Retaliation</span>
