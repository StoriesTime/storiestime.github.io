Lidia stood at the edge of the cliff, the sea crashing below her, her eyes fixed on the horizon where the sky met the water in an endless embrace. The town had been quiet for days, as it always was in the off-season. The tourists had long since gone, leaving behind only the ghosts of memories.</p><p>But Lidia wasn&rsquo;t thinking about the town or the fading waves. She was thinking about him.</p><p>David.</p><p>It had been two years since he left. Two years since he promised her that he&rsquo;d return, that they&rsquo;d continue their life together. He&rsquo;d held her hand and whispered in her ear, telling her that no matter where he went, no matter how far he traveled, he would always come back to her. That promise had kept her anchored, even as the days stretched on without him. But promises, she was learning, were fragile things. Sometimes they shattered under the weight of time and distance.</p><p>The letter had arrived just a few days ago. It was brief, written in a hurried, almost frantic scrawl. David was coming back. The letter spoke of a change in his life, of unfinished business that needed his return. It was enough to ignite a spark of hope in Lidia’s heart.</p><p>But there was a nagging feeling at the back of her mind. She had waited for so long, and every time he returned, it was never quite as he had promised. Their love had always been more of a promise than a reality, and every promise he made seemed to unravel just when she believed in it most.</p><p>Lidia turned and walked down the familiar path leading back to her cottage. The walls of her small home were lined with pictures of them, photographs capturing the fleeting moments of happiness they had shared. She reached the door and hesitated for a moment before entering. The place felt emptier than usual, though the memory of his presence still lingered in the air like a faint whisper.</p><p>She sat by the window, watching the waves crash against the rocks below, and tried to steady the chaos in her mind. She remembered the night they had met, how everything had seemed so certain then. He had promised her the world, and for a while, she believed him. But the world he had promised had always been elusive, like a mirage that shifted every time she got too close.</p><p>The first time he broke his promise had been subtle. It was when he left for a job opportunity in another city, and he had said it would only be for a year. One year turned into two, then three. Lidia had patiently waited, holding on to the idea of their future together. But as the months passed, she began to feel the weight of his absence. There were always excuses for why he couldn’t come home, why he couldn’t visit, why he couldn’t keep the promise he had made. She tried to convince herself that it was all for their future, but deep down, she knew it wasn’t.</p><p>The second time came after his return, when he promised to never leave again. He had seemed different when he came back, more distant. Their conversations became more about the things he had seen, the places he had been, than about them. His promises felt more like obligations he resented rather than declarations of love.</p><p>And then came the third promise, the one that had made her heart race with anticipation: “I’ll come back. I swear it.”</p><p>But he didn’t. The call never came. The promises stopped coming, and the silence was deafening. Lidia had held on to the hope that he would return, but time wore away at the edges of that hope until it crumbled to dust.</p><p>Now, with the letter in her hands, the hope was back. But so was the fear. The fear that this would be just like every other time, just another broken promise that would leave her heart heavier than before.</p><p>Her thoughts were interrupted by a knock on the door.</p><p>It was him. David.</p><p>Lidia’s heart skipped a beat as she rushed to the door, her breath caught in her throat. She opened it to find him standing there, looking much the same as he had the last time she saw him—tall, with unruly brown hair and a gaze that seemed to hold more secrets than it was willing to reveal. He smiled, but it was a smile that didn’t reach his eyes, a smile that felt like it was there out of obligation rather than joy.</p><p>“Lidia,” he said softly, stepping inside without waiting for an invitation. “I’m back.”</p><p>The words sent a shiver down her spine. She had wanted this, had dreamed of this moment, but now that it was here, she wasn’t sure how to feel.</p><p>“You’re back,” she repeated, her voice barely above a whisper. “After all this time, you’re finally back.”</p><p>David nodded, his eyes searching hers, as if looking for something he had lost. He was different now, not just in appearance but in the way he carried himself. There was a weight to him, something heavy that seemed to hang over the both of them.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” he said, his voice thick with regret. “I know I’ve broken so many promises to you. But this time, I’m here to stay.”</p><p>Lidia felt a lump form in her throat. She wanted to believe him. She wanted to feel the relief that came with hearing those words, but the weight of his past actions held her back. He had said those words before, and each time, they had been hollow.</p><p>“You said that before,” she replied, her voice trembling. “You promised me that you would never leave again.”</p><p>“I know,” he said, running a hand through his hair. “I failed you. I’m not proud of it. But I’ve changed, Lidia. I’m not the same person I was when I left.”</p><p>Lidia looked at him, studying his face for any sign of truth. The words hung between them, heavy and fragile, like an unspoken question. Could she trust him again? Could she allow herself to believe in a promise that had been broken so many times before?</p><p>David reached out, his hand brushing against hers. “Please, Lidia. I don’t expect you to forgive me right away, but I want to make it right. I want to prove that I can keep my promises.”</p><p>She closed her eyes, the battle within her heart raging. She had longed for this moment, for him to come back and fulfill the promises he had made. But now that he was here, she wasn’t sure if she could trust him again. It wasn’t just the promises; it was the way they had always been, as if their love was a collection of broken things held together by fragile hopes.</p><p>Finally, Lidia took a deep breath and pulled her hand away. “David,” she said, her voice steady now, “You can’t fix the past. You can’t undo all the times you left, all the promises you broke.”</p><p>David’s face fell, but Lidia continued, her heart heavy with the weight of her words.</p><p>“But,” she said, her voice softer now, “maybe we can start fresh. Maybe we can build something new. But it won’t be because of promises. It’ll be because we’re willing to make the effort every day. No more promises, just actions.”</p><p>David stared at her for a long moment, as if processing what she had said. He opened his mouth to speak, but no words came. Finally, he nodded, as if accepting the truth of her words.</p><p>“Okay,” he whispered. “No more promises. Just us.”</p><p>Lidia nodded, a small, sad smile tugging at the corners of her lips. She didn’t know if this time would be any different, but for the first time in a long time, she was willing to try. She had stopped waiting for promises to be kept. Now, she was ready to live without them.</p><p>And maybe, just maybe, that was where true change began.</p><p>The wind continued to howl outside, but inside the small cottage, there was a quiet understanding. The sea would still crash against the rocks below, and the promises would continue to be made and broken, but this time, Lidia wasn’t waiting for them anymore. She was simply living.</p><p>And that, for now, was enough.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/love-and-heartbreak/>Love and Heartbreak</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/pieces-of-us-short-stories-about-love-and-heartbreak/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Pieces of Us: Short Stories About Love and Heartbreak</span>
