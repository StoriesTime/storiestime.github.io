The rattling of the window sill was the only sound she could hear amidst the silence. The war had taken its toll, and the screech of an incoming shell was no longer a source of fear.</p><p>Maria&rsquo;s mind wandered to thoughts of her brother, Pierre, who had joined the 136th Infantry Regiment to fight in the trenches of Verdun. She hoped against hope that he was safe and away from the carnage. Renowned for their resilience, the French villagers adopted a new way of living: the men went to the war while the women stayed to hold the land together.</p><p>One evening, a stranger arrived at Maria&rsquo;s cottage. He was a young officer, injured and tattered, hunched over with a limp. Maria risked the wrath of her superiors and found him a place to rest and recuperate. She named him Yann, although she never learned his real name.</p><p>Yann spoke seldom, but when he did, his voice had a hint of the ocean and a chilling, raw quality. His left arm was bandaged and unusable, a mangled stump where his hand used to be. Despite the pain and trauma that mirrored in his eyes, there was an immense wisdom within him. Maria spent her nights nursing Yann and sharing stories of life before the war. Yann listened carefully, his eyes locking onto hers, filled with an untold sorrow. At night, when the moon reflected a pale light onto their faces, Maria shared stories of her village&rsquo;s glory days, its peace, and luxury.</p><p>One day, the village suffered a sudden attack. The enemy started targeting the communication lines, leaving the village in darkness and chaos. Determined to aid her village, Maria ventured out into the night, stealthily dodging the unseen enemy.</p><p>Dark and heavy, as the silence of the night seemed threatened to engulf the village, a strange noise disrupted the tranquility. It came in the form of rumbles and tremors, as if a giant demon danced with a mortal enemy. The air was thick with oppressive energy. Maria could feel the pitter-patter of raindrops against her cheeks as she clutched her shawl tight against her bare back, bracing herself for the unfathomable chaos to come.</p><p>Smoke billowed through the air as Maria caught sight of Yann, who stood motionless among the rubble and debris. His bandaged arm clung to his chest, and a silver knife glinted in his strong but mangled hand. His eyes were wide open, and his gaze was fixed on an enemy soldier at bay. Blood trickled from his lips, as if he had bitten himself to bear the excruciating pain. With one clumsy yet forceful swing, the blade cut through the night, rendering the enemy soldier silenced forever.</p><p>Maria could feel the coldness of the deed that had just taken place. So did Yann. Seeing the state of the village, the ruined earth, and witnessing the dreadful act of killing brought forth the realization that not everything was as it seemed. The enigmatic stranger had secrets that strangers weren&rsquo;t supposed to have.</p><p>As they sought refuge in the confines of Maria&rsquo;s home, she and Yann slowly uncovered the story of what lay beneath the surface. Yann confessed he was a fighter in the very trenches Pierre was stationed at. His honorable duty was to lead patrols and ambush the enemy still lurking unseen. Every man on the battlefield breathed heavily with dread of the Silent Enemy, a mysterious force that emerged in complete darkness and struck fear into the hearts of friends and foes alike.</p><p>The Silent Enemy - an advanced group of Northern European soldiers who used guerrilla tactics and shadow warfare, striking fear into any oncoming foes. Their existence ridiculed the unprepared French forces and rendered such valor and grit powerless. The thought of the relentless and ruthless attacks they made sent cold chills coursing down Maria&rsquo;s spine.</p><p>One day, the war appeared to have ended, and Yann vanished into the night as he materialized. And as the dust settled, the reality of what transpired began to chip away at the very notion of war. The male inhabitants of the village returned, weary and hollow, each one carrying an invisible chasm in their hearts - the unmistakable mark of their experience in the trenches at Verdun.</p><p>This tormented silencing of the human aspect continued on relentlessly. As different accounts sprung up, Maria sought the truth behind the Silent Enemy and its relevance in the echoes of this paralyzing war. She discovered that war had, inevitably, created the Silent Enemy as it perpetuated all other evils, motivating cold-blooded aggression fueled by greed, hatred, and fear.</p><p>With the return of the village men, life slowly resumed its normal functions. But a year later, the whispers of a new enemy began, rumors starting to surge with the arrival of a mysterious force - an all-new faction following a different creed and upbringing. This fraternity fought under a different flag and had seemingly sworn to avenge every blood-curdling scream - a faction surpassing every limit set forth by the Silent Enemy.</p><p>Silence, once again, made way for chilling warfare and destruction. The world watched as the silence took on a new form, darker and more terrifying than ever before. This chilling account burned itself into the hearts of the people who refused to forget those whom history had etched into its pages - the silenced and the silent.</p><p>The remnants of the Silent Enemy waged imperialistic wars, tearing through countless lives and enjoying the spoils of untold victories. And as the echoes of the unseen were drowned in the shadows of a brutal world, the tragic story of Maria, Yann, the Silent Enemy, and all those who fell victim to war&rsquo;s cruel pursuit, forced humanity to face the haunting consequences of neglecting the value of peace in the wake of strife.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/war-and-conflict/>War and Conflict</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/fragments-of-war-short-stories-of-loss-and-hope/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Fragments of War: Short Stories of Loss and Hope</span>
