Its rhythmic motion was mesmerizing, but instead of lulling him to sleep, it only fed the growing tempest of his thoughts. The fan spun fast, round and round, just like the unchecked cascade of worries in his mind. Even as the world outside his bedroom sighed into a peaceful slumber, Jackson’s thoughts spiraled into the abyss—louder, sharper, and unrelenting. This was what he called &ldquo;The Loop.&rdquo;</p><p>It never started with fireworks or chaos but always something innocuous. Tonight, for example, the spark came from a simple thought: Did he come off as rude during the meeting at work? He replayed the moment—over and over—sifting through every word, his tone, the flickering expressions of his colleagues. Someone had furrowed their brow as Jackson explained his numbers—was it confusion? Anger? Disapproval? He should’ve elaborated more. He should’ve stayed quiet. No, perhaps he should’ve gone further and asked for feedback.</p><p>A pang of regret coiled in his chest like a tight spring, and Jackson grimaced. This never led anywhere good. And yet, like a fly caught in a spider’s web, he found himself stuck, unable to untangle himself from the suffocating threads of self-doubt.</p><p><em>Why didn’t you just explain better?</em><br><em>What if they were annoyed?</em><br><em>They’ll probably remember this tomorrow.</em><br><em>Will they talk about you when you’re not around?</em><br><em>What if you lose their respect?</em></p><p>One thought fractured into ten; ten shattered into countless others, each laced with hypothetical scenarios and imagined consequences. Jackson groaned, squeezing his eyes shut as if it would silence the noise in his mind. But this was the curse of overthinking—logical reasoning had no place here. Reality dissolved, making way for assumptions and worst-case scenarios, all of which Jackson treated as gospel.</p><p>By the time the first tendrils of dawn painted the sky, Jackson slipped into a restless sleep, only to wake hours later, exhausted and irritable. The Loop’s toll wasn’t limited to sleepless nights. It followed him into the daylight, clouding his thoughts, sharpening his insecurities. Tasks at work felt monumental. Conversations became laden with subtle undertones that probably didn’t even exist. Every action, every decision, was replayed in his head, carved open for analysis that rarely yielded clarity but always inflicted self-inflicted wounds.</p><p>But for Jackson, this wasn’t new. The Loop had been his shadow since his teenage years. He couldn’t pinpoint exactly when or how it started. Maybe it had begun as a survival mechanism—a way to overanalyze situations to avoid mistakes, to anticipate how the world might judge him. Somewhere along the way, that protective instinct mutated into something more sinister, more destructive. The thoughts no longer protected him; they consumed him.</p><hr><p>Three weeks ago, Katie from accounting had mentioned an upcoming team-building event—a casual kayaking trip along the river that cut through the outskirts of town. Jackson had agreed at the time, nodding absently without fully considering what it entailed. Now, as the day loomed closer, The Loop seized upon the agreement, amplifying it into a full-blown catastrophe.</p><p>What if he toppled the kayak and made a fool of himself? What if his coworkers whispered about it afterward? What should he wear to express confidence or at least blend in? Or worse—what if something happened to him while he was out there in the water? People often underestimated rivers. Just last year, hadn’t he read some article about a man getting caught in a strong current?</p><p>The questions trailed one another like dominoes, knocking down his already fragile calm. Sitting at his desk during lunch, Jackson stared blankly at his untouched sandwich as his mind fueled anxiety after anxiety with no discernible exit. Part of him knew how irrational it all sounded. He could see how the looping thoughts stretched reality to its breaking point. But knowing didn’t mean controlling. The Loop was its own master.</p><hr><p>The day of the kayaking trip arrived, and true to form, Jackson had slept perhaps two or three restless hours the night before. He considered calling in sick—crafting the perfect excuse to dodge this social disaster—but something faint, almost imperceptible, tugged at him. Was it hope? Or simply his stubborn pride? He couldn’t say. But by mid-morning, he found himself at the water’s edge, awkwardly adjusting a life jacket while everyone else exchanged easy laughter.</p><p>As they pushed off into the current, Jackson latched onto every detail he could control. His grip. The kayak’s stability. The pace of his paddling. Yet the peace of the water was deceptive. The more outwardly calm his surroundings, the louder his inner critic became.</p><p><em>You’re going too slow.</em><br><em>Now you’re going too quickly. They’re probably laughing behind you.</em><br><em>Maybe they’re glad you came, just for the entertainment value.</em><br><em>Why didn’t you just stay home?</em></p><p>But then something happened—a shift so subtle, he almost missed it. As the river curved around a bend, sunlight fractured across the water’s surface, catching his eye. He paused mid-paddle, suddenly and inexplicably captivated. For a few seconds, there were no thoughts. The Loop, as loud and persistent as it had been all morning, fell silent, as though it had been rendered powerless in the light of the moment.</p><p>It didn’t erase the struggle, nor did it provide him with answers. But it was a glimpse—a crack in the shrouded perception that dominated his daily life. And for Jackson, that was enough. Enough to keep paddling forward, both on the river and, perhaps, within himself.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/mental-health-and-psychology/>Mental Health and Psychology</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-mirror-lies-facing-body-dysmorphia/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Mirror Lies: Facing Body Dysmorphia</span>
