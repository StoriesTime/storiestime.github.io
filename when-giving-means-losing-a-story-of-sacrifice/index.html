The village beneath those looming crags existed on the edge of enough—damp in the summers, howling with wind in the winters, always clutching a half-finished harvest in callused hands. Mina&rsquo;s father had called it “a land of persistence.” Her mother, with a gentler voice and a deeper wisdom, had only called it home.</p><p>From the day she was old enough to sweep the dirt floor of their small cottage, Mina learned the truth that everyone else in the village quietly accepted: there was never enough for everyone. Not enough bread, not enough sunlight in the short growing months, not enough time to rest. And so people learned to keep what they could for themselves, to shield their stores of grain with careful locks and wary glances. But not Mina. She was always the one to give.</p><p>At first, her mother scolded her gently when she returned home with empty hands and a broad smile. “You must be wise with what we have, little star,” she would say, kneeling by the hearth as she braided Mina’s hair. “Generosity is a river that can wash you away.”</p><p>One shivering winter, when Mina was eleven, the drought struck. The mountain streams shriveled to muddy trickles, and even the oldest oaks in the forest began to die. The village grew quieter with every passing week, as laughter and talk vanished, replaced by strained silence and furtive footsteps.</p><p>That year, Mina found an old man on the far edge of the woods, slumped against a tree, his breath rattling slow and thin as broken reeds in a cold wind. Strangers in the village were rare, and this stranger looked worse than any Mina had seen. His coat was ragged, his boots splayed apart by holes. He watched her with hollow eyes, and Mina, feeling the familiar fierce ache to help, knelt and pressed her only loaf of bread into his hands.</p><p>He ate like a starved dog, and when his head fell onto her shoulder in sleep, she wrapped him in her own coat and watched the night creep down the mountainside. The next morning, he was gone, her coat bundled beside her, the last crust of her bread missing too. In return, he had left nothing but a single copper coin in the snow.</p><p>That winter, Mina’s family barely scraped by. Her father came home limping from a fall in the forest, and Mina’s mother wept over the empty bread tin. Still, Mina kept finding ways to give: a handful of berries to a lean-faced girl with frost-nipped fingers, three eggs to a neighbor whose husband had not come back from the mines. Giving was the only time Mina felt the dull, relentless shriveling of their fortunes ease a little, the only time she felt she could breathe.</p><p>As Mina grew older, the world beyond the valley pressed itself closer. Roads grew rougher, travelers grew fewer, and word spread of great famines east and west, of border wars, of taxes rising with every full moon. Mina’s father died young, lungs ruined by dust and hard work, and her mother grew frail and spent. Mina watched the muscles on her own arms thicken, her cheeks hollow with missed meals, but she continued to give. Sometimes, she wondered if she was meant for it, born with a heart that bruised at every story of want, but a will that refused to snap.</p><p>When Mina was twenty-one, the worst drought in memory arrived. Cracks ran through the ground like broken glass, the wheat curled and died before midsummer. There were fewer people left in the village each day—families that could, fled for cities or green valleys far away.</p><p>But those who remained suffered deep. Mina’s mother lay in bed, breathing too shallowly, her bones sharp beneath the skin. The local healer, a woman as grim as an iron pot, told Mina privately: “She needs broth. Eggs. Cheese—something substantial. If you give away any more, you may lose her.”</p><p>Mina’s world contracted to the small circle of her home—her mother’s fevered moans, the rough hand-carved bowl, the meager stores in the pantry. But need was an animal that could slip beneath any door. She heard it in the cough of old Mrs. Brell down the lane, saw it in the sunken eyes of the boy whose father was lost to the war. Children knocked at the door, pleading, and Mina’s hands betrayed her heart every time, offering up their last turnip, their final wedge of sour cheese.</p><p>Her mother grew worse. Mina did not—could not—stop giving.</p><p>One afternoon, Mina found herself standing in the old chapel at the end of the lane. The leaded glass above the altar caught what little sun there was, throwing spears across the pews. Father Ril, austere and elegant in his threadbare robes, watched her from behind a curtain of incense smoke.</p><p>“My child,” he said. “What brings you here, besides the wind?”</p><p>Mina’s voice trembled. “I don’t know what to do. If I hoard what little we have, my mother might live. If I share, perhaps the others will too. But it seems that for every hand I fill, I let my own people sink further.”</p><p>Father Ril looked at her, eyes deep with something neither pity nor admonition. “We’re taught to serve, Mina, but service at the price of ourselves—what is left then to give?”</p><p>She looked at her own hands, empty now, lined and rough as split bark. “Sometimes I wonder if I’m feeding emptiness, Father. That the more I give, the more the world seems to want.”</p><p>The old priest said nothing. When she left, she had no more answers than before. The mountain stood indifferent in the distance, swallowing all words as it always had.</p><p>Days thinned. Mina’s mother could not rise from bed. The wheel of her dreams spun slow and gray. Mina sat by the window and watched the river, shrunken to a mere thread, winding between yellowed grasses and collapsing willow trees.</p><p>That morning, she woke before dawn and wandered toward the market square. She passed row after row of empty houses, lost gardens, shops with windows sealed tight against the world. She did not realize at first, as she walked, how light she felt—how the ache of fear and uncertainty had become a comfort, a familiar weight. How what had hurt most, in the end, was not the giving, but the slow rot of watching what she loved fade while being unable to help.</p><p>At the very center of the square, there sat an old woman, her eyes lucid and sharp beneath a mass of white hair. She beckoned Mina closer.</p><p>“You look tired, child. Tired of being needed.”</p><p>Mina wanted to speak, but the words caught in her throat.</p><p>The old woman considered her. “It is the oldest lesson—that when one gives everything, there may be nothing left of themselves. The world is hungry, always has been, always will be.”</p><p>“What do I do?” Mina finally asked. “What’s the cost of refusing to give?”</p><p>The woman smiled, dark humor in her gaze. “You’ll save your mother—maybe. You’ll save yourself—perhaps. But what else? Sometimes, all that giving means, child, is losing. And sometimes, that is the better way to lose.”</p><p>As the sun climbed, Mina returned home with a single piece of hard cheese clutched in her palm, her mother already fading, pale and thin.</p><p>Mina broke the cheese in half, sharing it with her mother, though it was all she had left. Her mother smiled faintly, mouthing a blessing. Mina held her hand, feeling the warmth fade slowly, feeling herself shrink with each breath lost. Tears came, but Mina did not look away.</p><p>When the last breath escaped her mother, the world seemed very still. There was no great light, no revelation. Just the soft weight of absence, and the sound of the river farther off—the same and different, as everything must be. Mina gathered her courage and left the house, walking past old neighbors, empty gardens, silent doors.</p><p>She did not stop giving—could not, for it filled a pain beyond her own hunger—but she finally learned how to hold a little for herself. A crust, a candle, a promise. Seed for next season’s ground.</p><p>Years passed. The village changed, like all things must. The rains returned one spring, and wildflowers sprang up along the battered roads. New faces arrived, new children’s laughter echoed among the houses. The mountain, unchanging and eternal, watched it all beneath the shifting sky.</p><p>Mina grew into her place—both giver and survivor, neither saint nor martyr, but something else: a root that clings to earth, a memory of someone whose giving bought not only loss, but space for others to begin anew.</p><p>Even in loss, she had planted something no famine or hardship could entirely erase. In the evenings, she walked to the banks of the river, its waters running fuller each season. She leaned into the dusk and listened to the song of it, grateful, at last, for what she had given and what she still had left to give.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/sacrifice-and-altruism/>Sacrifice and Altruism</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/when-giving-means-everything-tales-of-sacrifice/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>When Giving Means Everything: Tales of Sacrifice</span>
