Not the mighty pantheon of thunder and order that later tales would enshrine, but a wilder set: gods of brambles, darkness, silence, and lost roads. They slipped through the dawn mists, their powers woven into the common things that mortals overlooked. By the time men and women learned to pray to the Sunlord and the Maiden of Harvest, these older deities had faded—buried beneath memory, myth, and moss.</p><p>But legends do not die quietly.</p><hr><h3 id=1-the-pact-of-dust-and-moss>1. The Pact of Dust and Moss</h3><p>A half-forgotten village huddled between tangled woods and the restless tide. Its people whispered of Luck and Bad Weather, of omens lurking in cracks and corners. In Farthold, stories moved on the wind like pollen, settling in every crevice—unless, that is, you were one who didn’t listen.</p><p>Aras was one such—sixteen, all cheekbones, stubby fingers, and restless feet. Where others revered the old shrine beside the river, Aras saw only rotting wood and strange glyphs. Their mother, Meya, had overseen that shrine once, before she vanished—a wound in Aras’s heart they covered with layers of bravado.</p><p>It was on a night pricked with frost that change came. At the edge of sleep, Aras heard their mother’s voice, ragged and thin as wind in reeds:</p><blockquote><p><em>Child. The old gods are calling. Find me in the place of endings.</em></p></blockquote><p>Aras started awake, shivering, the message burning behind their eyes. Hunting for something that night, something more than answers, they gathered old boots, a tangle of rope, and the luck-stone they&rsquo;d found years before in the river mud.</p><hr><h3 id=2-the-forgotten-shrine>2. The Forgotten Shrine</h3><p>With dawn scraping the sky, Aras crossed the fields. There, by the fractured stones of the river-shrine, waited dark water and the crooked limbs of an alder tree. The river hissed, cold and barely trustworthy.</p><p>“So you heard it too?” rasped a voice—ancient, genderless, stirring memory.</p><p>Aras spun. On a boulder sat a figure as gnarled as driftwood, hair tangled with lichen and cobwebs.</p><p>“Who are you?” Aras asked, fist tightening on the luck-stone.</p><p>“Once, they called me Murgrol the Quiet. I shaped the silences between storms.” The god’s eyes were river-stone gray. “You seek the Forgotten. The world’s new gods have pushed us aside—yet the pact is breaking. Old powers strain at the edges. Your mother walked too far between.”</p><p>Aras wanted to chase the figure off, but curiosity caught them as swift as fear.</p><p>“What does it want with me?” they demanded.</p><p>“Nothing <em>wants</em> you," Murgrol mused. &ldquo;But the world owes you a secret: journey east, through the forest. There, where the Roadbreaker sleeps, you will find the passage.”</p><p>Thunder growled on the horizon. Aras did not glance back.</p><hr><h3 id=3-into-the-bramblewood>3. Into The Bramblewood</h3><p>The forest clawed at Aras’s boots. Paths twisted back on themselves, frogs croaked names Aras half-remembered. Every so often, a shape darted at the edge of sight—a fox with too many tails, a bird made entirely of shadow. Aras faltered, then stumbled through a heartbreak-thicket.</p><p>Night fell quickly under the canopy, heavy as velvet. Aras lit a spark with stone and steel but the fire hissed as if it bore a grudge. They drew their knees close, teeth chattering.</p><p>Moonlight lanced through the leaves, and from the gloom stepped another shape. Tall and lean, she shimmered cloakless, skin inked with stars.</p><p>“You tread the Forgotten’s path,” she said. “I am Sialam of Lost Roads.”</p><p>“You’re a god?”</p><p>“For as long as mortals lose their way, I am.” Her mouth curved, hungry. “You seek the place of endings?”</p><p>Aras nodded. “To find—someone left behind.”</p><p>Sialam offered a length of silver thread. “Tie this to your wrist. It will guide you. But know: when you reach the end, you may not like what waits.”</p><p>Aras’s pulse thumped. Every tale warned against bargains with gods, but what else was left to do? They tied the thread, feeling it pulse with otherworldly warmth.</p><hr><h3 id=4-the-roadbreakers-dream>4. The Roadbreaker’s Dream</h3><p>The forest gave way to ancient stone—ruins wrapped in vines, their arches honeycombed with mist. Underfoot, the remnants of a paved road snaked into darkness. As Aras crossed the threshold, the ground trembled. Something vast and slow exhaled below.</p><p>A hand—broad, root-knuckled—burst from the rubble. Then a second. A face, mournful and blind, rose from the earth. The air shook with its voice.</p><p>“Who awakens the Roadbreaker?”</p><p>“Aras of Farthold. I—I need to pass, to find the Forgotten gods.” The silver thread tugged at their wrist, bold and directionless now.</p><p>“There is a price for trespass,” rumbled the titan.</p><p>Aras’s tongue felt made of pebbles. “What do you want?”</p><p>“Tell me a truth no one will remember. In return, cross my ruins.”</p><p>Aras, desperate, searched their soul. They remembered Meya teaching them to whistle when frightened—the song of the frostbird, the one that always came home.</p><p>“My mother taught me a song so I’d never lose my way. But I can’t remember the notes. Only the feeling.”</p><p>The titan closed its eyes. “You have paid. Go.”</p><p>As Aras hurried past, they felt something ancient brush their shoulder—a blessing, or perhaps a warning.</p><hr><h3 id=5-echoes-in-the-valley-of-names>5. Echoes in the Valley of Names</h3><p>Beyond the Roadbreaker’s bones, the valley sprawled: a sea of shifting grasses, where hundreds of stone pillars listed in the loam. Each pillar was inscribed with a name.</p><p>Aras wandered, half-dreaming, as dawn washed the world gold. With each step, they whispered prayers to names: Mosira, who once guarded the blackberries; Ulth, the bringer of heavy sleep; Mirrothri, lord of puddles and secrets. With every prayer a faint image flickered—shapes of forgotten gods, more odd and tragic than mighty.</p><p>Behind the farthest monolith, Aras found her: Meya, eyes closed, hair strewn with bracken. Her arms shimmered with godmarks, curling like vines.</p><p>“Mama!” Aras cried.</p><p>Meya did not wake. The god Sialam stood close now, somber.</p><p>“She is held by Solnis, the final Forgotten. Sunken in memories. Only one who remembers the old ways can break the dream.”</p><p>Aras knelt and sang the frostbird song, or whatever scraps of it clung to their heart. They sang of riverbanks and nettle-burns, of honey-cakes Meya once baked, of small gods lurking in corners. The song grew—awkward, raw, carried by the longing to return what was lost.</p><p>Something shifted. Above, the valley filled with pale shapes, summoned by that half-remembered melody. The gods of dust and silence arose, drawn by unforgotten love.</p><p>Meya’s eyes fluttered open.</p><hr><h3 id=6-the-choice>6. The Choice</h3><p>Aras wept as Meya stirred. For a moment, the world was only mother and child.</p><p>But Sialam’s gaze was heavy. “The old gods waken, but this is not their world anymore. If they return, old wildness will follow. Storms without reason, roads unraveled—will you uphold their memory, or lay them to rest?”</p><p>The Forgotten hovered, brightening, shadows flickering with uncertainty. Aras understood: to choose one was to renounce the other—to let the old ways return, or fade completely from the world’s pulse.</p><p>Aras looked at their mother, who held pain in her eyes but also hope. “Let the world change, but never forget. Record these stories: not as warnings, but as possibilities.”</p><p>Meya nodded. The gods, their forms flickering with gratitude and sorrow, began to fade—not to nothing, but into legend, into tale and song.</p><p>Sialam offered a final gift: a map of lost roads, its lines shifting and alive. “For whenever you, or your kin, choose to remember again.”</p><hr><h3 id=7-the-returning>7. The Returning</h3><p>Aras returned to Farthold with Meya, the silver thread on their wrist a quiet glow. They became keepers of old stories, teaching that somewhere, just beyond the edge of forgetting, wild gods watched and waited. No one in the village would ever look at the river shrine the same way again.</p><p>Sometimes, Aras glimpsed strange shapes at twilight: gods of moss, of silence, of dreams. They winked from the shadows, never quite gone.</p><p>And in the hush between storm and sunlight, when the world tilted strange, Aras would smile—knowing that the Forgotten gods, and their long-lost magic, lived on wherever story and memory entwined.</p><hr><p>The rivers would rise, the woods would whisper, but now, when someone walked the thin paths between, they did so with a song in their heart, and a map of lost roads cradled in their mind. The Forgotten were not gone—they had simply learned to wait, and to trust in the hearts that dare to remember.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/mythology-and-legends/>Mythology and Legends</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-everlasting-quest-for-the-golden-fleece-a-revisit-to-ancient-greece/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Everlasting Quest for the Golden Fleece: A Revisit to Ancient Greece</span>
