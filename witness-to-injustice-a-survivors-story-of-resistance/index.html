It was a moment that changed the course of my life forever. Growing up in the once-thriving town of Oakdale, I saw the streets transform into a battleground as inequality and defiance took hold.
My name is Maya, and I am a witness to the chaos that unfolded. As a young person, I was often caught in the middle, trying to navigate the treacherous landscape of social change. The protests, the patrolling police, the marches, and the tears-filled rallies - our town was ablaze with the desire for justice. Yet, the embers of inequality continued to burn, consuming everything in their path.
It started with small acts of defiance. I would see people holding signs and participating in rallies against the local government's oppressive policies. They railed against the discriminatory laws and racial profiling that targeted our community. I saw friends and neighbors arrested, injured, or humiliated by the very authorities sworn to protect and serve.
As a seventeen-year-old, I was among the crowd that initially joined the cause. The marchers sang chants and carried banners with the names of the fallen and the wronged. They clutched photographs of those who had lost their lives to brutality, refusing to be silenced. I held up my own sign, scribbled in frustration and anger, voicing the exact words everyone was scared to say aloud.
As the protests continued, the saying "I can't breathe" echoed throughout our streets. The very air we breathed in was one of desperation. Brutal force was used against peaceful protesters, entire families were forced out of their homes due to gentrification, and family members were torn apart by rhetoric revealing animosity and hate.
Then, it all changed for me.
One sweltering summer night, as I rode my bike down the sidewalks of Oakdale, I witnessed something that would haunt me for years to come. Mr. Howard, a dependable father and pillar of our community, was halted by a police officer on an arbitrary errand. Howard was ordered to present his backpack, which contained nothing but courtesy medication to help alleviate chronic MS.

Witness to Injustice: A Survivor's Story of Resistance
I still remember the day I decided to speak out against the injustices I witnessed in my community. It was a moment that changed the course of my life forever. Growing up in the once-thriving town of Oakdale, I saw the streets transform into a battleground as inequality and defiance took hold.

Mr. Howard, a dependable father and pillar of our community, was halted by a police officer on an arbitrary errand. Howard was ordered to present his backpack, which contained nothing but courtesy medication to help alleviate chronic MS.
The officer's behavior was borderline cruel, and his words dripped with an unsettling tone. I saw the anger in Mr. Howard's eyes as he pleaded with the officer to understand his condition. The officer remained unmoved, instead elevating his hand to Mr. Howard's face.
