The buzz of coffee makers drowning out sleepy murmurs, the soft clicking of keyboards filling the air, and employees trudging to their desks with the enthusiasm of marathon runners nearing the final mile. But this particular Monday was different.</p><p>It all started with the duck.</p><p>No one knew how or why a rubber duck had found its way into the middle of the office floor. Sitting inconspicuously between HR and the Marketing department, the bright-yellow, oversized bath toy seemed oddly out of place. Some thought it was a prank; others assumed it was a quirky corporate bonding experiment. When Susan from Accounting tripped over it while carrying her morning latte, theories about its origins quickly became the least of anyone&rsquo;s concerns. The incident was a catalyst for chaos—a bizarre, laughter-fueled chain of events that would turn the entire office upside down.</p><hr><h2 id=the-duck-controversy><strong>The Duck Controversy</strong></h2><p>“Alright, whose idea of humor is this?” Susan demanded, holding the offending duck aloft like a prosecutor presenting Exhibit A. Several employees poked their heads over the tops of gray cubicle walls, eyes wide as whispers darted from desk to desk.</p><p>Ted, the junior IT technician whose humor repertoire prominently featured dad jokes, sniffed indignantly. “Don’t look at me. If I put a duck anywhere, it’d be on a pond or a plate of orange sauce. Not the carpet.”</p><p>A muffled snort of laughter emerged from the design team’s corner. Quietly, Alex, the company’s graphic designer, raised a hand. “Actually, it’s mine.”</p><p>The room pivoted toward Alex as if their collective disbelief were some gravitational force. Alex, notorious for showing up to meetings wearing mismatched socks and occasionally doodling on memos, shrugged nonchalantly. “It’s a stress duck. I got it during a conference last year. Squeeze it, and it makes this really calming squeak.”</p><p>Alex gave the duck a demonstrative squeeze. Indeed, it emitted a soft, comical <em>squeak</em>, akin to a pun that had taken physical form. The effect was instantaneous. Even Susan, who had been moments away from lodging a formal complaint about workplace hazards, let out a chuckle.</p><hr><h2 id=the-high-stakes-squeaky-war><strong>The High-Stakes Squeaky War</strong></h2><p>What started as a curiosity soon turned into corporate sport. Employees began sneaking the duck onto each other’s desks, tucking it into desk drawers or perching it precariously atop stacks of reports. By Wednesday, it had escalated to a full-blown competition with spontaneous rules and unspoken alliances.</p><p>“You can’t <em>just</em> hide the duck—it has to be creative,” insisted Maya from Marketing, who had taken it upon herself to establish the “Duck Points System.” “Bonus points if it’s somewhere the person least expects it. Negative points if the discovery doesn’t result in an audible reaction.”</p><p>Doug from HR clearly hadn’t gotten the memo. He taped the duck to the bottom of the snack room table, assuming that subtlety equaled creativity. But when Daniel from Legal spotted it during his routine nap under the table, the reaction was far from audible. In fact, Daniel’s confused yelp of, “WHY IS THERE A DUCK IN THE CEILING?!” was heard three floors up, even though the duck wasn’t anywhere near the ceiling.</p><p>By Friday, the scorekeeping had become so convoluted that Maya scribbled equations on the office’s whiteboard that appeared one step shy of resembling quantum physics. Points for creativity. Points for confusion. Deduction of points if anyone physically injured themselves during duck retrieval. All attempts by management to stop this “nuisance” were quickly neutralized by the fact that even the managers were invested in the outcome.</p><hr><h2 id=the-incident-in-conference-room-b><strong>The Incident in Conference Room B</strong></h2><p>Like all office competitions, things spiraled spectacularly out of control the moment someone brought snacks.</p><p>Anton, who managed Cloudspire’s customer service team and also moonlighted as an amateur baker, arrived at work with a box of homemade éclairs. Since Conference Room B had been recently abandoned after last month’s ironically titled workshop—&ldquo;Maximizing Office Productivity&rdquo;—the éclairs were safely stowed there during working hours. Or so Anton thought.</p><p>Imagine his surprise when, midafternoon, he returned to retrieve his box of shiny-topped éclairs, only to find that the duck had been surgically inserted into the frosting on each dessert. Tiny rubber beaks peeked out from between layers of glossy chocolate, and every éclair was garnished with enough bright yellow to resemble Chewbacca experiencing static shock.</p><p>“I hate to admit it,” Anton muttered, holding up a grotesque pastry like Hamlet clutching Yorick’s skull, “but this is high art.”</p><p>Meanwhile, in an effort to blend in, the original duck sat quietly on the conference table, its glossy surface dusted with a suspicious sprinkling of powdered sugar. The blame game ignited immediately.</p><hr><h2 id=when-corporate-got-involved><strong>When Corporate Got Involved</strong></h2><p>By the following week, news of the “squeaky situation” had reached Eleanor VanHorne, the company’s regional director visiting from headquarters. Known for her no-nonsense demeanor, Eleanor’s unspoken motto appeared to be “fun is for coffee breaks and free evenings alone.”</p><p>Seated at the head of the executive conference table on Tuesday morning, Eleanor addressed the fidgeting employees with a steely calm. “Explain the duck.”</p><p>A dramatic beat of silence passed. Employees exchanged glances, silently debating which among them would take the fall. But before anyone could speak, a single hand shot up. It was none other than Ted, the IT technician.</p><p>“I put it there,” Ted declared, and gasps rippled through the room. The absurdity of being the fall guy for a runaway rubber duck prank seemed lost on no one, least of all Ted himself, whose expression betrayed an odd mix of panic and defiance.</p><p>“And why,” Eleanor continued coolly, “did you think a hazardous bath toy would be appropriate in the workplace?”</p><p>Ted opened his mouth, possibly to confess that it wasn’t actually his prank to begin with, but was cut off by an unexpected sound. A loud, deliberate <em>squeak</em> silenced the room. All eyes turned to Eleanor herself, clutching the duck like she’d just pulled a rabbit from a hat.</p><p>“This thing is hilarious.” Eleanor couldn’t hide her smirk.</p><p>Laughter erupted like a dam had burst.</p><hr><h2 id=the-duck-resolution><strong>The Duck Resolution</strong></h2><p>By month’s end, every employee had their own desk duck, courtesy of Eleanor’s follow-up initiative: <em>Operation Duck-tegrationTM—Promoting Fun in the Workplace</em>. Custom Cloudspire-branded ducks became a company tradition, complete with yearly awards for “Most Creative Duck Setup,” “Squeak MVP,” and the coveted “Rubber Duck Hall of Fame.”</p><p>Years later, when the company expanded to six countries, one constant remained: the unmistakable sound of a squeaky duck somewhere in the building. The small toy that had once thrown an entire office into disarray had become an unlikely symbol of camaraderie and corporate absurdity.</p><p>For Cloudspire employees, there was only one unspoken motto: when the spreadsheets are slow, when projects hit a snag, there’s always time for a good laugh—and a loud <em>squeak</em>.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/comedy-and-humor/>Comedy and Humor</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/laughing-through-the-worst-job-interview-ever/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Laughing Through the Worst Job Interview Ever</span>
