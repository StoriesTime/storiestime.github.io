The Union's ultimate goal was to cut off the Confederacy from the Trans-Mississippi, severing a vital transportation route and crippling the nation's ability to wage war. The defenders of Vicksburg, led by General Ulysses S. Grant, were determined to hold their ground.
The Siege Begins
Grant's army of approximately 48,000 soldiers encircled the city, once a bustling port and industrial center, cutting off all escape routes and supplies. The Union forces, bolstered by the contributions of African American units, poured artillery fire down on the city, causing widespread destruction and stifling the defenders' attempts to launch sorties against them. The once-thriving trading center had become a seedy network of makeshift camps and bewildered refugees.
The Last Remnants of the Confederate Army
General Joseph E. Johnston, in charge of the Confederate forces, had set up shop in Jackson, Mississippi, 40 miles east of Vicksburg. Knowing that the effects of Union General William T. Sherman's march south would soon reach his command, Johnston decided to concentrate his meager resources in a doomed attempt to stall the Union advance. He set up camp in a low-lying area 14 miles east of the city, unsure whether to settle in or push the union forces northward.
State of Siege
Grant exerted his powers as Union commander to declare martial law throughout the city, extending his Army's discipline and influence over every corner of the city. Over ten days passed before dissidents on both sides could mount a vitriolic protest, for Grant and his troops worked selflessly, extracting key resources from Coxwell, Covevert lines and neighboring towns.

The Siege of Vicksburg: A Turning Point in American History
In the sweltering summer of 1863, the city of Vicksburg, Mississippi, was the focus of a Union army's relentless assault on the last major stronghold of the Confederacy on the Mississippi River. The Union's ultimate goal was to cut off the Confederacy from the Trans-Mississippi, severing a vital transportation route and crippling the nation's ability to wage war. The defenders of Vicksburg, led by General Ulysses S. Grant, were determined to hold their ground.
The Siege Begins
Grant's army of approximately 48,000 soldiers encircled the city, cutting off all escape routes and supplies. The Union forces, bolstered by the contributions of African American units, poured artillery fire down on the city, causing widespread destruction and stifling the defenders' attempts to launch sorties against them.
The Last Remnants of the Confederate Army
General Joseph E. Johnston, in charge of the Confederate forces, had set up shop in Jackson, Mississippi, 40 miles east of Vicksburg. Knowing that the effects of Union General William T.

Over ten days passed before dissidents on both sides could mount a vitriolic protest, but Grant and his troops worked tirelessly, extracting key resources from Coxwell, Cove, ert lines, and neighboring towns.
Confederates Fall on Hard Times
Despite dire predictions that they would not be able to withstand Union cannonade, the Confederate forces showed surprising resilience. However, their situation was becoming increasingly dire, and their lines were being stretched thin. The city's defenders were doing everything in their power to hold out, but it was only a matter of time before the Union forces would prevail.
The Turning Point
On July 4, 1863, after a brutal 47-day siege, General Grant's forces launched a final assault on the Confederate lines. The defenders, exhausted and demoralized, were unable to withstand the onslaught. On July 4, 1863, the city of Vicksburg fell, marking a turning point in the war. The city's defenses were breached, and the Confederate forces were forced to surrender.
The Union victory at Vicksburg was a significant blow to the Confederacy, as it gave the Union control of the Mississippi River and split the Confederacy in two. The war would continue for another year and a half, but the fall of Vicksburg marked a significant turning point in the conflict, one that paved the way for the ultimate defeat of the Confederacy.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/famous-battles/>Famous Battles</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-siege-of-vicksburg-a-battle-of-wits-and-willpower/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Siege of Vicksburg: A Battle of Wits and Willpower</span>
