A child of unrivaled innocence and tender grace, she charmed all who crossed her path with her boundless spiritedness and kind-heartedness.</p><p>Lila had the sort of soft, velvety hair that changed with the seasons, and her eyes were like a clear, fresh pond in the dappled sunlight, reflecting the simplest emotions and twinned certainties of life: love and loss. In the beginning, they were the color of the sky at dusk, a deep, silvery blue.</p><p>She had lived in this village for as long as she could remember. In the peace and the calm of the sight and sound of the hills, she was raised by her grandmother, a kind, warm woman with a penchant for telling stories. It was in her grandmother&rsquo;s lap that Lila first peeped into the world: a brittle, thin and fragile seedling soaking up her grandmother&rsquo;s love. Their bond was immense, limitless and of a shimmering, golden hue.</p><p>One day, though, a subtle darkness snuck into the village. It arrived on the wings of secrecy, and it nestled in the hearts of even the most revered and trustworthy of villagers. This darkness harbored a sinister and pulsing energy that even the bravest of hearts could not ignore, an uneasiness that permeated every breath, every word. This darkness cast its shadow on Lila, on her young heart, and it seemed to caress and cling to her.</p><p>It was a chillier autumn than most when a stranger arrived in the village. The stranger had shiny black eyes like the night sky and wore a warm, gray overcoat that seemed to tremble with its own hidden secrets. The villagers speculated about the stranger, whispered of his taxi-brown car and the crescent curve of his lips. Some whispered of mystery, others of wealth. But even in the swirl of conjecture, few guessed that this stranger&rsquo;s presence would change the village forever.</p><p>Lila could feel the darkness encroaching upon her, and as she played alone in the fields of her grandmother&rsquo;s house, she yearned for the glow of her grandmother&rsquo;s voice that usually soothed her ever-growing anxiety. Yet alas, her grandmother&rsquo;s silence was her comfort at that time; an unspoken understanding of the strange times they were in. It was as if the darkness had turned her translucent, making her floating, hovering on the edge of liminality, desperately trying to maintain balance.</p><p>One day, the stranger approached her in the fields.</p><p>&ldquo;Do not fret, young one,&rdquo; he said with a gentle and drawn out drawl. &ldquo;Your eyes are a vault for the cosmos. Would you care to help me, as a favor to my own girl, a friend that I am desperately searching for?&rdquo;</p><p>Lila, inspired by his charm, was fixed. Any other time, she would have turned away, tightened in by her grandmother&rsquo;s watchful love, but her innocence had been slowly peeling away, layer by layer, like the hesitant peeling of a sunburnt skin. As much as her mind screamed at her to stay, she found herself nodding, wordless. The solemn bond she shared with her grandmother felt like a slow, cold dagger, a secret tearing her into tearing pieces.</p><p>The stranger revealed a bundle of brightly colored chalks, untouched and unyielding, from his coat. &ldquo;These will guide us,&rdquo; he whispered in her ear, the scent of lilacs engulfing her senses.</p><p>The loneliness that she carried with her, the longing for her grandmother and the fear that had writhed within her, they regaled her with reasons to accept the stranger&rsquo;s offer. With each step she took with the stranger, the sun began to dip lower in the sky.</p><p>&ldquo;Do not be afraid, child,&rdquo; he assured her as they tread into the dusk of the village, reaching for the fading light. &ldquo;You are safe with me.&rdquo;</p><p>As they prowled the streets of the village in the dusk, her mind was awash with a myriad of colors, an endless symphony of dulcet hues that filled her sight and mind. Orange, green, red, blue – colors like Lila had never seen. They strolled and danced along the edges of different villager&rsquo;s homes, the scent of a strangely luring and oddly familiar palo santo wood permeating the village air.</p><p>A sudden understanding washed over her like a tidal wave. The darkness had taken her innocence, and in its stead, she had found a world forever changed. It was here, with the stranger, that she would find her power – the power to see the hidden beauty of the world, to hear the unheard melodies.</p><p>But as she looked back at her own village, it had morphed into an entirely unfamiliar place - the sun had dipped too low. The shadows had lengthened, and her heart trembled, now sleek like a fish, out of water, floating on the cold, dark waves of reality.</p><p>The stranger asked, &ldquo;Now, young one, do you think you can find your friend for me?&rdquo;</p><p>With those words, the darkness and the colors swirled together, woven in an intricacy that could make stars blush – but in her new heart, both heavy and light, her search had commenced, peace and pain merging, and Lila stepped into the suffused darkness, forever bound by both light and shadow.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/childhood-and-adolescence/>Childhood and Adolescence</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/innocence-lost-childhood-through-the-years/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Innocence Lost: Childhood Through the Years</span>
