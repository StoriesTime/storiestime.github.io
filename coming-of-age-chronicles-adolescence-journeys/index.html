It was owned by a stern old man named Adamos, known for his shrewd eyes and firm hands. Every young lad and lass in Usas could tell you tales of that orchard which they were either too afraid or too curious to explore.</p><p>When the village entire woke up one morning to find tiny boats docked near the shore, filled with shiny, glistening apples, a strange wave of change surmounted the village. The apples were like none they&rsquo;d ever seen before, with colors ranging from deep ruby to golden yellow. They tasted different too, sweeter and more vibrant, carrying with each bite the promise of stronger, unyielding magic.</p><p>Adamos, however, remained stoic, fire still smoldering in his eyes. He fetched a lad, Javiera, a spirited and intelligent girl celebrating her fourteenth birthday that year. With her brunette curls and bright green eyes, Javiera matched the caliber of the oddapple orchard. A friendship akin to a rock was formed between them, bonds of trust solidifying with each day Javiera spent in the orchard. But Javiera was yet to discover what sat amidst the trees, heavier than any fruit, buried deep and dormant in the roots.</p><p>The summer turned to autumn and left a carpet of red, orange, and yellow hues. The village bustled with life, everyone abuzz with Adamos&rsquo;s apples, whispers filling the air like a symphony. Beneath the apple harvest&rsquo;s overshadowing, life-size cardboard cutouts began to spring up on the sides of houses, mimicking village lads and lasses. Usas turned into a real anthropomorphic village as villagers flocked to a game show, conducted remotely via a webcam set up in a room. The contestants had to choose one of the cardboard men or women, costume them and play character by repeating storylines attributed to them, and the show hosted by a flamboyant stranger who always seemed to be juggling several towns over an hour. All to win the elusive Apple Lottery Prize - the chance to own a piece of Adamos’s magical apple orchard and the apples it bore.</p><p>Javiera spoke to Adamos one afternoon, sitting on the worn Ottoman in his room. The air was thick and usually, but on this day, it felt heavy.</p><p>&ldquo;Adamos, the village has changed.&rdquo; She said, her normally bright eyes dark and pinched, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not Usas anymore, it’s Usasylvania.&rdquo;</p><p>Adamos released a long sigh. He spread the fingers of his weathered hand on the tabletop, observing its ripples across the glass.</p><p>&ldquo;Aye, lad,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;Change is inevitable, like water ripples when a stone is dropped.&rdquo;</p><p>Javiera painted a picture of the village&rsquo;s buzz to Adamos who listened patiently. From the doorstep of his home, he saw an artist of Usasylvania. Colorful posters, fliers and life-size cutouts, festivals and booths. A world where music played and flashed brighter than the sun, with the legend of his apples, the story of his soil being sold piecemeal.</p><p>He recognized the feeling, but in his herbs, not in his fruit. &ldquo;Adamos, isn&rsquo;t it funny then, that you and I care for those same fruits?&rdquo; Javiera gestured to the still outdoors, &ldquo;They have become a part of our village, and yet, we have become strangers to them.&rdquo;</p><p>Adamos smiled, his rugged face undergoing an intriguing mix of sadness and joy.</p><p>As autumn ended, Javiera found herself alone in the orchard, Adamos having locked himself in his home.</p><p>As she wandered, arms laden with apples, a peculiar sight met her. Amidst the trees, coiled and entwined like a snaky, writhing dance was a great and fierce root, violating deep beyond what it was meant to. Into it, pressed and imprinted in the earth&rsquo;s core were lush, fragrant petals. Javiera had to peel back the earth to reveal its identity.</p><p>The orchard&rsquo;s magic stemmed from here; this was the source of the village&rsquo;s sweet, unyielding buzz. And as she stood above it, the soil heavy in her hands, Javiera understood. She knew the age-old question, the heartbreak of companionship, the reason behind the change. She knew the truth of the mad scientist and his potions, the tales of the unbelievable bounty harvested daily.</p><p>The tale of Adamos and his orchard.</p><p>Usas was left chasing the echo of its past, while the Usasylvania swung to the rhythm of a new beat, masterfully played by the melodies born from the converted village. The Usas that Javiera had come to know and love had slipped away, but the Usas inside her and the other villagers grew stronger, brighter.</p><p>Adamos finally unveiled his last masterpiece, the beautiful, lush vine of vines entangled and established within the roots of the orchard. Painstakingly the orchard had grown, a new dance had been birthed amidst the trees. A rhythmic, pulsating illumination that spoke of a new world order.</p><p>The village and the orchard had always grown together, and in that autumn, they took their places as the twosome they always were. The true magic of the orchard finally unfolded. A testament to the dance in harmony with the earth, in tune with the love of the trees, and in rhythm with the care of the heart that had touched the soil Adamos&rsquo; hands had held.</p><p>Change had come, not as the stripping away of their existence, as they&rsquo;d feared, but instead, change arrived in the form of a new routine, the painting of new tales, and the awakening of once slumbering lands.</p><p>Javiera had come of age, and with the turning of the season, so did the village. Not as strangers to the outsides and the insides of their beautiful home, but as companions, caretakers, and the proud relatives of the orchard.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/childhood-and-adolescence/>Childhood and Adolescence</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/childhoods-forgotten-memories-a-story-of-lost-innocence/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Childhood's Forgotten Memories: A Story of Lost Innocence</span>
