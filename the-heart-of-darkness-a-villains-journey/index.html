His days blurred as the relentless sun beat down upon his weathered skin, but little did anyone know that a cauldron of obsession churned beneath the surface of this grizzled soldier.
A century ago, the world had turned Ewen's values on their head. Once, the British Empire had been the epitome of civilization, spreading its bounty and progress to the benighted lands. Now, however, its corrupting tendrils snaked through the very heart of Africa, bringing ruin and despair in their wake. Yet Ewen had not deserted his fellows; far from it – his conviction had taken a drastic detour.
A most peculiar path lay before him – a winding trail of darkness that stretched towards the mysterious realm of the Makolodo people, infamous for their taboo practices and untold riches. Intricate patterns etched upon palm fronds and faded leather artifacts hinted at their elusive presence in the unfathomable vastness of that unforgiving expanse. He dreamed of unravelling the enigma shrouding this fabled tribe.
Colonel Ewen's descent into darkness was well underway before anyone noticed.
Secret Mercenaries
To the outside world, Ewen's army unit fought on in the trenches of an unforgiving conflict, ever the soldiers fighting the unrelenting imperial wars. Little did his comrades know, however, Ewen had secretly sold his soul to a cabal of rogue power brokers, haggling over terms for a clandestine mission far from the colonial frontier.
Breadcrumbs of confidential writings revealed to his trusted few hinted at the involvement of a shadowy presence within the London circles. For his part, he cherished the solitude and grew more involved with an unwholesome influence in the military.
Secrets of the Makolodo
========================-
Leaning into his days of clandestine negotiations, the Colonel unearthed an intricate and ancient prophecy among the lore of the enigmatic Makolodo. Rumored as a sanctuary of ancient knowledge, rumored to be rooted in the unknown regions of an unknowable beyond.
With every passing year, Ewen grew increasingly desperate. Feverently cultivating his network of shady informants, on the precipice of calamity, he lanced the dark underbelly of his most entrenched allegiances. Little did he know, a most sinister adversary whispered dark truths of a possible key to unfathomable power locked within the taboos of the ancient Africans.
With the unfolding darkness within him, Colonel Ewen's world crumbled. Rumors wafted up through smoke-filled taverns and city-side coffeehouses alike, spoke of whispered enmities within those tightly guarded societies – tales of treacherous schemes colliding head-on, in endless firs exchanges of interests between the outcast colonists.
Secrets of Africa remained close guarded, in line of colonial schemes now fraught with a maelstrom of interlocks: a chasm widening between fragile colonial interests and darker, cruel persuasions of nature long abandoned by those who walked the imposing dark expanse that cradled the African Continent
Amongst these shadow forces dwelt a Colonel Ewen's inscrutable adversary, quietly steering the affairs – shadow ruler known well to both past and future for orchestrations that left ghosts in every community strangled – between those battling to control a place to remain aloof on two grand scales of human culture.
This cold, calculated heart still spoke eloquently with time itself, evoker of shadows, only dark hours witnessed this unknown force; darkness that pursued him through what were unbecoming and perhaps doomed places of twisted allegiences – relentless in pursuit.
Dark Ascendancy
Many would speculate Ewen held captive within his troubled soul the shadow within himself, this dark siren blinding him to greater calamity. One particular instance could seal Ewen's fate and complete a most sinister turning. How would he step and proceed as the once-great British outpost cracked further with treachery everywhere? Who would be left standing when centuries old pacts unraveled – drawing with it those dreadful silences that came first just before devastation?
There is confusion and many are not able - those lost souls.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/villains-and-antagonists/>Villains and Antagonists</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-forgotten-antagonist-redemption-in-the-shadows/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Forgotten Antagonist: Redemption in the Shadows</span>
