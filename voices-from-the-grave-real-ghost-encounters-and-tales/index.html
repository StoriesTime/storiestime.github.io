The paint was chipped and peeling, and the roof sagged as if it were bearing the weight of countless secrets. The locals called it the Morrow House, and for as long as anyone could remember, it had been abandoned. Yet, every now and then, someone would venture near it, only to return with a story so strange that it was hard to believe.</p><p>Some called it haunted. Others, simply cursed. But those who had the courage to enter its decaying halls spoke of voices—whispers in the dark, faint echoes of long-dead souls. Whether these voices were the product of imagination, the wind, or something more sinister, no one could say. However, one thing was certain: the Morrow House had stories to tell.</p><h3 id=the-first-encounter>The First Encounter</h3><p>It was a cold autumn night when Jared and his friends decided to explore the house. Jared, always the skeptic, had heard the rumors of the house’s hauntings and thought them to be nothing more than local folklore. To him, there was no such thing as ghosts. But he was curious, and when his friends proposed an adventure into the heart of the woods, he couldn’t resist. Armed with flashlights and a healthy dose of bravado, they made their way through the overgrown path leading to the house.</p><p>As they pushed open the creaking front door, a wave of cold air rushed past them, causing the hairs on the back of Jared&rsquo;s neck to stand on end. The house was silent, the kind of silence that presses against your ears, making you feel like you&rsquo;re being watched. Dust hung in the air, suspended in the beams of their flashlights. The wooden floors groaned beneath their feet as they made their way deeper into the house, their shadows dancing on the walls.</p><p>&ldquo;Are we really doing this?&rdquo; Mark, one of Jared’s friends, asked. His voice was tense, and his eyes darted around, trying to pierce the darkness.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Jared said, trying to sound confident, but even he could feel the unease creeping in. &ldquo;It’s just an old house. There’s nothing to be afraid of.&rdquo;</p><p>But the house seemed to have its own plans. As they moved deeper into the main hallway, a low, almost inaudible sound filled the air. It wasn’t the wind. It wasn’t the creaking of the house. It was a voice.</p><p>“Help me.”</p><p>The words were soft, barely a whisper, but they cut through the silence like a knife. Jared froze. His flashlight flickered as if responding to the eerie sound. His friends looked at each other, a mixture of fear and confusion in their eyes.</p><p>“Did you hear that?” Mark whispered.</p><p>Jared nodded, his heart pounding in his chest. The voice had come from upstairs, from one of the bedrooms. Without thinking, they made their way up the staircase, the old wood groaning beneath their feet as they ascended. The air grew colder the higher they went, and the darkness seemed to press in on them.</p><p>They reached the top of the stairs, and the voice came again, louder this time.</p><p>“Help me&mldr; please.”</p><p>It was coming from the room at the end of the hall.</p><p>Jared hesitated. This wasn’t a prank. This wasn’t his imagination. Something—someone—was calling out for help. With a shaky breath, he pushed open the door, his flashlight beam illuminating the room. The air was thick with dust, and the furniture was covered in white sheets, as if the house had been abandoned for decades. But in the corner, standing by the window, was a figure.</p><p>A woman.</p><p>She was dressed in an old-fashioned gown, her hair long and disheveled. Her back was turned to them, but as they entered, she slowly turned around. Her face was pale, her eyes hollow, and her mouth hung open as if she were trying to speak but couldn’t. Her hands were outstretched, her fingers twitching.</p><p>&ldquo;Please&mldr;&rdquo; the voice whispered again, but it was no longer coming from the woman. It was coming from everywhere, as if the very walls of the house were speaking.</p><p>Jared couldn’t move. He felt rooted to the spot, unable to look away. His friends were equally frozen, their eyes wide with terror. And then, as quickly as it had appeared, the woman vanished.</p><p>The room was empty.</p><p>The silence returned, but it was a different kind of silence now—a heavy, oppressive stillness that weighed down on them. They rushed out of the room, stumbling over each other, and bolted down the stairs. As they exited the house, the door slammed shut behind them with a deafening bang.</p><p>Outside, the air was still, the forest eerily quiet. None of them spoke as they walked away from the house. Jared&rsquo;s heart was still racing, and he could feel the weight of what they had just experienced pressing on him.</p><p>“What was that?” Mark finally asked, his voice barely above a whisper.</p><p>“I don’t know,” Jared admitted, his voice shaking. “But that was real. I don’t think we’re alone here.”</p><h3 id=the-second-encounter>The Second Encounter</h3><p>Months passed, but the memory of that night never left Jared. He thought about it often, especially when he was alone in his apartment, the darkness pressing in around him. He couldn’t shake the feeling that something was watching him, something that had followed him out of the Morrow House.</p><p>It was late one evening when he first heard the voice again.</p><p>At first, it was a whisper, just a faint murmur from the corner of the room. Jared sat up, his heart thudding in his chest. He strained his ears, trying to make out the words. The voice was soft, but clear.</p><p>“Help me.”</p><p>Jared’s blood ran cold. It was the same voice—the same desperate plea he had heard in the house. He looked around the room, but there was no one there. Just the shadows, stretching across the walls in the dim light. The voice came again, louder this time, as if it were right next to him.</p><p>“Help me…”</p><p>Jared jumped out of bed, his pulse racing. He fumbled for his phone and called Mark, but the line was dead. The voice continued to whisper, growing louder and more frantic.</p><p>“Please… help me… don’t leave me…”</p><p>The words were almost intelligible, like the speaker was struggling to form them. It was coming from the walls, the floor, the very air around him. Panic gripped him as he backed into a corner, his breath coming in short, shallow gasps.</p><p>Suddenly, there was silence. The voice disappeared, leaving Jared alone in the stillness of the room. He didn’t know what to make of it, but deep down, he knew one thing: the house wasn’t finished with him yet.</p><h3 id=the-truth-behind-the-voices>The Truth Behind the Voices</h3><p>In the weeks that followed, Jared became obsessed with the Morrow House. He visited the local library, searching through old records and newspaper clippings for any information about the house and its history. What he uncovered shocked him.</p><p>The house had once belonged to a family named the Morrow, who had lived there for generations. According to local legends, the family had been involved in a series of mysterious disappearances, with several of their children vanishing without a trace. Some said they had been victims of foul play, others believed they had been taken by something far more sinister.</p><p>But the most chilling discovery came when Jared found the name of the woman he had seen in the house. Her name was Eleanor Morrow, and she had died in the house under strange circumstances. The reports claimed that she had been found in the attic, her body bruised and broken, her face frozen in an expression of terror.</p><p>The police had never solved her murder. Some believed it was a domestic dispute that had gone horribly wrong. Others, however, whispered that Eleanor had been a victim of something far darker—a force that still haunted the Morrow House to this day.</p><p>Jared returned to the house, determined to uncover the truth. He entered the darkened halls once again, but this time, he was prepared. Armed with nothing but his flashlight and his resolve, he ventured upstairs to the room where he had seen Eleanor.</p><p>As he entered, the temperature dropped. The air thickened, and the whispering voices returned. They were everywhere, swirling around him like a storm.</p><p>“Help me…”</p><p>The voice was unmistakable. Eleanor’s voice.</p><p>Jared stepped forward, his flashlight trembling in his hand. The shadows in the room seemed to shift, forming shapes in the corners of his vision. He called out to her, his voice steady despite the fear creeping up his spine.</p><p>“I’m here to help you,” he said, though he wasn’t sure what he meant by it. “Tell me what happened.”</p><p>For a moment, there was silence. Then, the voice returned, clearer than ever.</p><p>“I didn’t die alone,” it whispered. “I’m not the only one trapped here.”</p><p>Jared’s heart sank. The realization hit him hard: the house wasn’t haunted by one spirit, but by many. They were all trapped in the house, victims of some terrible fate, doomed to repeat their final moments forever.</p><p>The voices began to grow louder, more insistent.</p><p>“Help us…”</p><p>Jared’s flashlight flickered and died.</p><p>The room plunged into darkness.</p><hr><p>The next morning, Jared’s friends found him standing outside the house, his face pale and his eyes wide with terror. He didn’t speak a word. Whatever he had experienced that night, whatever truth he had uncovered, had left him forever changed.</p><p>The Morrow House still stands, its windows dark and empty. And though many have ventured into its haunted halls, none have returned with answers. The voices from the grave continue to call out, waiting for someone to listen, waiting for someone to set them free.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/ghost-stories/>Ghost Stories</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/voices-from-beyond-creepy-encounters-with-the-supernatural/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Voices from Beyond: Creepy Encounters with the Supernatural</span>
