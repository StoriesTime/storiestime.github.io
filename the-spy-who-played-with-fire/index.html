Laughter, music, the warmth of early summer, and in the shadow of the Old Town Hall, a woman watched from behind mirrored sunglasses. She wore a yellow dress with sunflowers, stood against the raucous tide, and waited. Munich was bright with festival, but Mara Solace did not feel festive. Her gloved hands tugged at a silk scarf around her throat—Mara was not a creature of comfort, nor of peace.</p><p>At 3:17, the signal came: a man in a charcoal suit with a crimson rose. He bought a pretzel from a vendor, flicked his lighter three times. That lighter—chipped enamel, a flame like molten gold—had been Mara’s signal since the Berlin job years ago. She breathed out the tension as she walked. Ordinary, drifting to the pretzel stand, ordinary enough to vanish.</p><p>“Miss?” he murmured, German accent swollen with London vowels.</p><p>She chose her words carefully. “Is this where the lions dance?”</p><p>He offered a paper napkin with crumbs. “They dance if you feed them.”</p><p>Inside the napkin: a matchbook, printed in white with the word FEUER. It bulged with a microSD taped into the spine, smaller than a fingernail. Mara took it and walked on, aware of the sweat in her lower back, the thump of her heart, the way the map of the city folded and unfolded in her head. She had replayed the route a hundred times. If she walked away now—if she walked anywhere but the rendezvous—would the eyes in the statues, in the windows, reel her back in?</p><p>No. She was committed, and in this world, commitment was gasoline.</p><hr><p>The drop-off was at Café Waldmeister, five blocks north. Mara scribbled a note in the matchbook’s paper—FIRE AT MIDNIGHT—and left it in the designated lamppost. The streets shimmered with heat; her own skin felt raw, every nerve raised. As she stepped into the cool, dim-lit café, the air thick with espresso and baking sweets, a bell tinkled, and silence reigned for a second before the room returned to its drone.</p><p>Her handler, Frau Lenka, was waiting with a silver laptop and a half-eaten apple strudel. &ldquo;You are early,&rdquo; Lenka said, voice like cracked ice, eyes sharp as phosphorus.</p><p>&ldquo;The exchange happened,&rdquo; Mara said, not sitting, not lowering her scarf. &ldquo;He gave me the flame.&rdquo;</p><p>Lenka tapped the hard drive embedded in her machine. &ldquo;Then let us see if our friend burned bridges this time.&rdquo;</p><p>She inserted the microSD. Patterns of code cascaded: plans, identities, dates, encrypted with a cypher that ate itself alive every sixty seconds.</p><p>Mara didn’t need the screens—she watched Lenka’s face. When Lenka’s nostrils flared, Mara saw the trigger: Project Feuerland. The blueprints for a chemical plant near the Czech border, but not just a plant. There were annotations involving burn rates, ignition points, cargo shipments. In Mara’s business, fire was never metaphor alone.</p><p>Lenka swore softly. “Our asset was right. They want to incinerate eastern corridors. Not just the pipelines.” She clicked steadily, unshaken. “The formula is here.”</p><p>By now, Mara’s pulse was a percussion line. “Do we stop them? Or do we watch it burn?”</p><p>“Stopping is for soldiers,” said Lenka. “Watching is for poets. We play. Here.” She drew out a new lighter—gleaming, blank. “Put on your gloves.”</p><p>Mara slipped her hand in the pocket of her coat, fingers closing around an object more dangerous than any gun: a ceramic vial of liquid accelerant, disguised as perfume. People in her line of work used fire both literally and as a game—the line between arson and espionage was as thin as a trail of gasoline.</p><hr><p>Two nights later, beneath a gunmetal sky in Ostrava, a city that always smelled like a spark about to catch, Mara walked the back alleys. Rain blurred everything to watercolor hues. She reached the old tram depot, for once truly alone. The deeper into the East she traveled, the less she trusted her shadows, but tonight, the only company was a stray dog limping after her.</p><p>Inside, the target: a rusted locker, marked with a black star. She snapped on a miniature flashlight, hood up. She’d planted the accelerant two hours before, smeared in an arc around the hinges. She listened—silence except for petrol dripping—then struck the lighter and touched the flame to the metal.</p><p>The reaction was instant. Fire blossomed white, then blue, then glass-bright orange, a barrier no one could cross without skin melting. From her glove, Mara flung a flashdrive into the inferno, watching it dissolve—all those names, those plans—her own included—disappearing forever.</p><p>Alarms sounded in the distance, but Mara was already walking. Her task was not just sabotage, but erasure. To be a spy was to create nothing, leave nothing, love nothing—except the mission, which itself was a wick burning down.</p><hr><p>The game picked up speed. Days bled into nights as Mara wove through Berlin, Prague, Vienna, always chasing rumors of fire—literal and not. Her adversary revealed himself slowly: a man called Nikola Sokolov, famed for starting wars by flicking a cigarette and letting the embers become legend.</p><p>He taunted her. A book of matches on her hotel pillow. A scorched chess piece in her mailbox. The message was clear: “I know you. Try and catch me.”</p><p>She played back. Turned up at meetings early, swapped her routes, sometimes losing her own tail for days at a time. But he always surfaced—sometimes in a crowd’s reflection, sometimes just a laughing echo in an underground bar.</p><p>She understood him. Fire attracts, repels, trickles between the fingers of those arrogant enough to dance with it. In another life, Mara might have been his apprentice instead of adversary.</p><hr><p>The confrontation came in Warsaw, on a night licked with cordite and exhaust. Mara checked into a building that looked abandoned from the street, but glowed golden behind blackout curtains. Sokolov waited atop the stairs, backlit and unmistakable, a silver Zippo in one hand.</p><p>He grinned. “My burning shadow.”</p><p>She stepped carefully, coat heavy with hidden weapons—including a vial of quick-light phosphorous. “You like to set things alight, but never get burned.”</p><p>He tossed the lighter in the air, caught it. “How else to see—without burning away the darkness?”</p><p>Mara reached into her pocket and held out a new matchbook—FEUER. “You’re finished. The files are gone. Your fires will die.”</p><p>He only laughed, stepping closer. “There’s always another fire, Mara. You and I—and Lenka, and the ones before her—we’re just the ones who tend the flames.”</p><p>She thought of the faces she’d betrayed, the cities she’d left smoldering. There was no innocence left.</p><p>Sokolov gestured up the stairs. “End it, then. But can you leave without lighting something behind you?”</p><p>She struck a match. The flame arced between them. In the glow, she saw her own reflection in his eyes—a keeper of fire, a bringer and eraser of names.</p><p>She hurled the match to the floor. The accelerant she&rsquo;d scattered earlier took hold, hungry orange light blooming up the walls. Sokolov smiled, unafraid, as if he’d always known she would give in to the old urge: to burn it all down in order to be free.</p><p>She ran.</p><hr><p>Mara made it through the back halls, down a twisting staircase, into a Warsaw sunrise that smelled already of ash and new grass. Sirens fell behind her as she walked into the uncertain day, another agent erased, another secret gone in smoke.</p><p>She didn’t know Sokolov would follow—she half-hoped, half-dreaded. But when the fire was out, and the world dimmed to ordinary heat, she would still be a spy, hands warm, heart cooler than any ashes.</p><p>In the distance, a pigeon landed beside her, then flew on, taking nothing, leaving only the smallest disturbance in the air. Mara allowed herself a smile. She might play with fire, but she would never burn.</p><p>She never had to. Others did that for her.</p><hr><p>The rivers of people flowed again—Prague, Zurich, Paris. Mara Solace moved in the currents, sunflower dress or midnight suit, always hunting, always hunted. Her gloves stayed clean, but under the fabric, her skin bore the memory of flame.</p><p>To play with fire is to risk everything. And so, she did—over and over, until the world blurred, and the only truth left was the heat she carried like a secret, alive in her blood.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/espionage-and-spies/>Espionage and Spies</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-spy-who-played-both-sides/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Spy Who Played Both Sides</span>
