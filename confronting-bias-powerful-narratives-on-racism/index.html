She couldn&rsquo;t shake the unease brewing in the pit of her stomach. The tension of the past few weeks had left her hypersensitive to any signs of prejudice.</p><p>Marissa, a young black woman, had recently started a new job at a prestigious tech company in the heart of the city. The job had been a dream come true, one she&rsquo;d worked tirelessly to achieve. But the first few weeks had been a whirlwind of microaggressions and continuous subtle racism. Her coworkers seemed oblivious to the impact of their words and actions, blithely forging on, leaving her reeling and disheartened.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe you made partner already,&rdquo; Marissa&rsquo;s friend Hadley had exclaimed when she shared her new job. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to be so successful!&rdquo; It was a well-meaning compliment, but it belied deeper, insidious thoughts about who Marissa was perceived to be.</p><p>Marissa checked her phone, her boss&rsquo;s email staring back at her: <em>Reminder to be mindful of &ldquo;cultural differences&rdquo; as we move forward</em>. It wasn&rsquo;t the first time she&rsquo;d received such a message. An implication that her presence and her achievements were somehow unfamiliar or unexpected.</p><p>Lost in thought, Marissa failed to notice the red light at first. As cars honked behind her, she jumped, startled, realizing that she wasn&rsquo;t just lost in thought but lost in the moment. Did the honks reflect annoyance or something more sinister?</p><p>As she stepped off the curb to cross the street, Marissa recognized Mr. Johnson, an older gentleman with a kind face. He always smiled and offered a friendly greeting on his way to his bus stop. Marissa waved, thinking about the countless times he&rsquo;d opened doors for her or held elevators with a warm, &ldquo;Good morning!&rdquo;</p><p>But this time, Mr. Johnson&rsquo;s gaze lingered on Marissa, his smile fading slightly. She felt her heart quicken. Was he merely curious, or was there more to his stare? She couldn&rsquo;t tell. Mr. Johnson had always been polite. Was his change in behavior a product of her own heightened emotions, or had there been a shift in how he saw her?</p><p>Marissa forced a smile, hoping to break the tension. &ldquo;Good morning, Mr. Johnson. How are you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing well, dear,&rdquo; he said, his smile returning. &ldquo;You seem lost in thought. Is everything alright?&rdquo;</p><p>Taken aback by his perceptiveness, Marissa hesitated before answering. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just trying to process some things.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; Mr. Johnson nodded, his smile turning sagacious. &ldquo;Trust takes time to develop, especially in this world.&rdquo;</p><p>His statement hit Marissa hard. She realized then that Mr. Johnson had his own experiences, his own battles with prejudice. The burden of their complexity weighed on them both.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Mr. Johnson,&rdquo; Marissa sighed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still figuring out how to navigate it all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Remember, there&rsquo;s wisdom in patience,&rdquo; he imparted, his gaze lingering on her face before finally drifting away. &ldquo;Good luck on your journey.&rdquo;</p><p>She watched Mr. Johnson board the bus, his figure disappearing beyond the window. Her mind was abuzz, analyzing their exchange and its implications as her boss&rsquo;s email flitted back into her thoughts.</p><p><em>Confronting Bias</em>, her boss&rsquo;s email sujet, seemed to be more than just an empty platitude. It was a refrain Marissa was beginning to wholeheartedly embrace—she had to confront her own ignorance about Mr. Johnson and others, just as she had to confront her employer&rsquo;s stereotypical assumptions.</p><p>Marissa&rsquo;s eyes trace the patterns on the sidewalk before her, contemplating what, if anything, she&rsquo;d revealed to Mr. Johnson about her own experiences. She understood the stakes now; it wasn&rsquo;t just about her, it was about making the world a little kinder and a bit more equitable. Marissa felt a renewed resolve, but she knew the path wouldn&rsquo;t be an easy one.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, she stepped off the curb and continued her commute, hope glimmering within. Murmuring under her breath, Marissa repeated <em>wisdom in patience</em> as she continued her journey, eyes firmly on the road ahead. She would confront the intersection of prejudice and power, one step at a time.</p><hr><p><em>This is a work of fiction.
