The world’s mundane rhythm conspired to lull him into rote routine, and perhaps that’s why he didn’t notice the change at first. Or maybe — as Max tumbled through the boundaries of reality — there’s no way anyone <em>could</em> notice the delicate crackle of worlds folding like origami.</p><p>He was late. Of course he was. Bolt down the stairs, nearly trip over the mailman’s stack of parcels. Forget the keys. Forget the time.</p><p>By the time Max reached Kraft & Ellison’s ancient front door, his hands shook from caffeine and frustration. No sooner did he swipe his badge and step across the threshold than the world became unglued.</p><p>He felt it—a humming thrum, a split-second longer than a shudder, like his bones were being rewritten. One heartbeat, and the lobby’s tired carpeting and flickering florescents&mldr; evaporated.</p><p>The world tipped, and Max fell.</p><p>When he landed, knees first, on a road slick with rain, his confusion surpassed the burning in his palms. He looked up. The place was familiar—a city block not unlike the one outside his office—but changed, as if a giant child had rearranged the skyline with clumsy, irreverent hands. Neon signs scrawled messages in scripts he couldn’t decipher. Cars hovered inches above the asphalt. A trio of pedestrians in reflective cloaks floated past, heads cocked in silent judgment.</p><p>Max’s mind stuttered. Denial bloomed. Every sense insisted this was real. The world spun with possibility.</p><p>He stumbled forward, scanning for any recognizable detail. A news vendor’s stall sat beneath an awning, digital front pages scrolling across a pane of glass. The photos—yes, that was the city. Except, in the corners, buildings he knew had vanished, replaced by silvery towers blooming with plant life. And the date—he blinked.</p><p>&ldquo;June 2, 2099.&rdquo;</p><p>Impossible.</p><p>A voice startled him. “You’re not from here, are you?” A woman regarded him, one eyebrow arched with the particular skepticism of someone who’d seen anomalies before.</p><p>Max could only gape. She was younger than him, with hair shaved down one side and a coat woven from something that glimmered like oil. “What?” he managed.</p><p>She squinted, tapping her cheek. “You’re carrying the wrong frequencies. You look… fuzzy. Unstable.” She leaned closer. “You’re a traveler.”</p><p>Max thought of science fiction novels, abandoned dreams, the way time sometimes feels like it’s slipping away before you can grab it. All his life, he’d wanted magic. Now, it had ambushed him. “I—I don’t know how I got here. I was at work. Then—”</p><p>“Yeah, it happens.” She offered a rueful smile. “Mostly to people who don’t want it.”</p><p>His panic surged. “How do I get back?”</p><p>She shrugged, as if he’d asked directions to a doughnut shop and she’d never heard of doughnuts. “Well, first, you should stop blending in. You’re drawing stares.” She jerked her chin. “Walk with me. Name’s Isla.”</p><p>Max followed, questions piling up like autumn leaves: Was this real? Some elaborate prank? A psychotic break? But every physical detail was too crisp, too tangible—the yield of his footsteps against strange concrete, the rush of wind, the chemical scent of rain.</p><p>He walked beside Isla, dodging drenched cyclists and street vendors selling cubes of pomegranate jelly. She didn’t bother with small talk, moving with the elastic confidence of a local. As they ducked into an alley lined with iridescent graffiti, she turned abruptly.</p><p>“This doesn’t usually happen by accident,” Isla said, voice low. “You step between worlds for a reason.”</p><p>“I didn’t ask for this,” Max insisted.</p><p>“Sure,” she replied, “but something did.” She reached into a pocket and pulled out a twist of wire and glass. “Here. Anchor.” She pressed it into his palm, warm and thrumming.</p><p>He clutched it. A pulse surged through his fingers—nothing painful, just a curious certainty that the object recognized him. “What is it?”</p><p>“A node. It marks your frequency. Helps stabilize you so you don’t… fade.” She mimed flickering with her hand. “Don’t lose it.”</p><p>He nodded, numb.</p><p>Isla cracked her knuckles. “If you want my help,” she said, “I’ll need yours. There’s something I left behind in another world. If you help me get it, I’ll show you how to get home.”</p><p>He considered refusing, but uncertainty gnawed at him. Besides, what choice did he have?</p><p>“Okay,” he said. “Deal.”</p><hr><p>The next leap came without warning.</p><p>Isla barely touched her node—an obsidian shard around her throat—before the world peeled open, peeling away like the skin from tender fruit. Vertigo was constant, a scraping at the back of Max’s mind, but after a moment he adjusted to a new reality. He braced himself, feeling the laws of physics lurch then reset.</p><p>He landed on gravel, eyes watering from a burning, sulfuric breeze. It was night—some alien night, lit by twin moons squatting over craggy mountains. The city around them was sprawled and uneven, architecture jagged like broken teeth. He squeezed his anchor, grateful for its steadiness.</p><p>Isla surveyed the landscape with intent. “This is my home,” she murmured. “Well, close enough. Stay near me.”</p><p>They walked along winding streets illuminated by floating, bioluminescent orbs. Max tried to memorize details—the way doors were taller than windows, the strange animals chittering in the darkness. He glanced at Isla, who strode with purpose.</p><p>“Who are you, really?” he ventured.</p><p>She shrugged. “Traveler. Smuggler, sometimes. I run messages. Steal things back from people who took them. Not very romantic.”</p><p>“Why do you do it?”</p><p>Isla stopped in front of a crooked doorway. “Because sometimes,” she said, “the only way out is through.”</p><p>She rapped three times on the door. It swung open, revealing a cluttered shop. Shelves groaned with artifacts: books bound in coral, prisms spinning in perpetual motion, a battered chess set with pieces carved from bone.</p><p>An old man, his hair a nest of wires, squinted at them. “Isla.” His accent skittered between syllables, unsettling yet melodic. “And… outsider.”</p><p>“Jez,” Isla replied, “I need the compass.”</p><p>The old man tsked. “Stolen. As always. You bring trouble.”</p><p>She smiled tightly. “I need it back. For both of us.”</p><p>Jez’s gaze darted to Max. “He doesn’t belong. He’ll fracture if left too long.”</p><p>Max felt exposed. “I want to go home. That’s all.”</p><p>“Compass isn’t here,” Jez said. “Taken by Maelor’s crew.”</p><p>Isla cursed softly. “Of course.”</p><p>Jez plucked a silver coin from behind Max’s ear. “Luck,” he said. “You’ll need it.”</p><p>They left Jez’s shop and crossed the city’s labyrinth, Isla setting a punishing pace. Max struggled to keep up, senses flickering. He wanted to believe he was dreaming. That was the mercy of dreams, wasn’t it? The assurance of waking.</p><p>But this place—its dirt, its cold, the pressure of another world’s atmosphere—felt terribly honest.</p><p>Eventually, they reached a squat building smothered in vines. Isla motioned for silence. “That’s Maelor’s den. He collects stolen things—sentimental or dangerous.”</p><p>She jimmied a window open and slipped inside. Max followed, heart slamming. They crept through dim, cluttered rooms and found themselves in a chamber glittering with objects from a hundred realities: an antique radio, a jar of glowing insects, a wristwatch with a face that never settled on one time.</p><p>Isla bent over a cluttered desk, rummaging.</p><p>“Got it,” she whispered, holding up a compass. Its needle spun erratically, colors rippling along its rim.</p><p>“Now what?” Max asked.</p><p>But before Isla could reply, a hulking figure loomed in the threshold, broad as a refrigerator and twice as surly. “Thieves,” he rumbled. “I <em>was</em> warned.”</p><p>Maelor—if that was Maelor—smiled without mirth. “You owe a toll.”</p><p>Isla’s hand dipped towards her pocket. Max, paralyzed, remembered Jez’s coin. With nothing to lose, he lobbed it at the brute. It spun through the air, shining like a falling star. Maelor snatched it, eyes widening, then froze.</p><p>Isla grabbed Max’s wrist. “Now!”</p><p>They tumbled back through the window and tore through night-soaked alleys. Behind them, Maelor howled, but the coin’s luck held—a toppled cart blocked his pursuit.</p><p>Isla, laughing breathlessly, spun the compass. A blue-green light darted over its surface. “Got what we need. Ready?”</p><p>Max nodded, trembling.</p><p>She pressed her node and the compass together. The world veered, colors inverted, gravity sucked sideways—</p><p>—and he landed in a garden of glass trees.</p><hr><p>The worlds tumbled past: a city blanketed in perpetual twilight, its streets mapped in constellations; a library so vast it seemed to dream of eternity, where sentient tomes murmured secrets as you passed; a desert where rain fell upward, forming rivers of mist.</p><p>With each crossing, Max felt reality slip—each anchor a tiny rebellion against entropy. But the ache inside him grew with every leap. He was an anomaly, increasingly out of joint.</p><p>Isla never offered apologies. She was a fixed point in a mosaic of chaos, sharp and determined, somehow unbreakable.</p><p>They climbed a tower slicing clouds. Isla pressed her face to diamond panes. “Compass says next world might be your gateway,” she told Max. She handed him a fragment of porcelain. “Last piece. When the portal opens, you’ll know.”</p><p>They stepped through, and this time, Max felt no fear.</p><hr><p>He blinked, knees crumpling, the world solidifying around him. Steel-gray clouds, a scent of rain. He was back—staring at Kraft & Ellison’s dull brown door.</p><p>He wept, not because he was lost, but because he was found.</p><p>A hand settled on his shoulder. Isla. Somehow.</p><p>“This is as far as I go,” she murmured, gaze softer than he remembered.</p><p>“Will I see you again?” Max asked.</p><p>“Maybe,” she said. “In some world. In some when.”</p><p>He pressed the fragment of porcelain into her palm. “For luck.”</p><p>She smiled, and the world flickered.</p><p>He stood alone on the threshold. For a long time, he didn’t move.</p><p>Then, with the memory of impossible journeys humming in his bones, Max stepped inside.</p><hr><p>He’d always thought of time as a river—relentless, linear. Now he knew better.</p><p>Time was an ocean: wild, unpredictable, teeming with parallel possibilities. Somewhere, Isla walked other worlds. Somewhere, another Max discovered the boundaries of his universe were more porous than advertised.</p><p>In that infinite sea of possibility, today was just another ripple. He’d carry the memory forever; not of being lost, but of daring to find his way through.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/time-travel-and-alternate-realities/>Time Travel and Alternate Realities</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/lost-in-time-a-journey-through-alternate-realities-and-what-ifs/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Lost in Time: A Journey Through Alternate Realities and What-Ifs</span>
