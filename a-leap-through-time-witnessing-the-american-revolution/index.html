As a members-only librarian, Tara had access to a top-secret room in the historical society&rsquo;s basement. But that was far from her current reality. Instead, she was placed in a far more extraordinary position. She was given a single opportunity to leap back into time and witness the historical events that had shaped the course of American history. And Tara could think of no better moment, no better location than the American Revolution.</p><p>Before she realized the importance and implications of her upcoming journey, her instruction was concise and clear. &ldquo;Tara,&rdquo; Mr. Smith, the curator of the historical society said, &ldquo;you are the embodiment of an historical witness. We believe in your ability to see the unseeable and hear the unhearable.&rdquo; Thus, with a single, unassuming flick of a candle, Tara disappeared from the historical society, and found herself in the presence of George Washington himself.</p><p>Tara&rsquo;s eyes widened as she processed her surroundings. She was no longer in the stuffy library; instead, she was surrounded by the smell of horses, damp earth, and muddy encampments. She could hear the hushed whispers of soldiers as they prepared for the night, their teeth chattering in the chilly air.</p><p>The American forces were holed up in a small town named Saratoga that day. The Battle of Saratoga was about to begin, and the American side appeared to be vastly outnumbered. Colonel Benedict Arnold briefed his troops about the enemy movements, instructing them to remain vigilant about their surroundings. Tara&rsquo;s heart raced as she found herself in a small footprint tent just behind the Continental Army lines.</p><p>While Tara was no stranger to knowledge, experiencing it firsthand offered her a richness she could not have acquired in a library. She saw the courage in the eyes of the soldiers and heard whispers that echoed and terrified her. A soldier cursed as he stumbled over Tara, recovering quickly from his fall. Tara couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder what would have happened if he had tripped in the decisive moment of battle.</p><p>Days later, the militias prepared to march, a solemn quiet preceding the anticipated show of force. Feeling a mix of fear and excitement, Tara watched as the troops moved with a purpose, some exhibiting a sense of dread, others a determined look. As the cannons boomed, Tara felt the vibrations in her chest, indicating momentous change was about to occur.</p><p>A soldier touched her shoulder, jolting Tara back to reality. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time, miss,&rdquo; he said softly.</p><p>Tara didn&rsquo;t know if she was ready to witness more bloodshed or to be in the firing line. Before leaving, she looked around and was momentarily lost in the sight of fellow soldiers she would soon depart from.</p><p>Tara was instructed to seek out a key figure of the Revolution, her mind instantly pulling up a familiar name - Benjamin Franklin. With a sense of urgency, she took to searching the encampment. Tara found Franklin tucked away in his tent, engrossed in reading an old, worn parchment.</p><p>Drawing in her breath, she nervously knocked on the tent entrance. Franklin looked up, surprised to see Tara.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello, Mr. Franklin, my name is Tara. I was wondering if I could trouble you for a moment and perhaps gain some insight into the unfolding events?&rdquo; Tara queried, watching as the old statesman&rsquo;s eyes sparkled.</p><p>&ldquo;I do not take kindly to strangers,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;but I must say, I&rsquo;m intrigued by your presence here.&rdquo;</p><p>Days turned to a week, then two, as Tara roamed with Franklin, witnessing many of the key skirmishes. She learned that the war was not as simple as she had believed. Fear and trepidation were not always aimed at the enemy; they were also present within the soldiers themselves, including her newfound comrade.</p><p>The tide of the Revolution gradually began to turn, with Washington&rsquo;s forces seizing the opportunity to launch more effective campaigns. The close calls, the strategies, the sacrifice - all part of their pursuit of independence, which seemed less like a dream and more tangible by the day.</p><p>Although Tara witnessed firsthand accounts of the Revolution and the impact of the war, there was one crucial matter she hadn&rsquo;t fully comprehended while observing history.</p><p>As the Revolution neared its conclusion, Tara and Franklin were standing on high ground, watching the troops training below. Franklin turned to her and said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something you should know, Tara.&rdquo;</p><p>He then revealed the truth about her presence in the past - one that was centuries removed from the Revolution. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not from here, are you?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>Tara hesitated; her entire perspective shattered. Could she be a mere observer to history? How could she have not seen it before?</p><p>She took a deep breath and responded, &ldquo;No, I am not.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; Franklin questioned. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not part of the fabric of this time, why have you been allowed to witness such events?&rdquo;</p><p>Tara explained about the historical society and the opportunity granted to her. Franklin&rsquo;s eyes widened in disbelief. But in the end, she had become dedicated to the war effort and fighting for independence. Nonetheless, only existing in this time temporarily.</p><p>As the war ended, Tara received mixed emotions from Franklin. While she had been both witness and participant, Tara now understood the gravity and permanence of her role. &ldquo;The Battle of Saratoga wasn&rsquo;t the end of the war, as we know, but it&rsquo;s a crucial turning point,&rdquo; Franklin said. &ldquo;And, in my humble opinion, you&rsquo;re a turning point, too.&rdquo;</p><p>With a smile, Tara responded, &ldquo;Only time will tell, Mr. Franklin.&rdquo; Then, with a subtle nod to the familiar figure, she leaped back through time.</p><p>The Revolution had shaped her, and now, it was time to return to the present. Tara re-emerged in the historical society&rsquo;s library, opening her eyes to a world vastly different from the one she had left behind, yet forever connected through the memories of her extraordinary experience.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/historical-events/>Historical Events</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/a-kingdom-in-ruins-the-fall-of-the-aztec-empire/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>A Kingdom in Ruins: The Fall of the Aztec Empire</span>
