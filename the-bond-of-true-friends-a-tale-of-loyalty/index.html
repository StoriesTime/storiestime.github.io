In the heart of the old elementary school, now long deserted, two figures sat back-to-back: Elyas, quietly inspecting the soles of his sneakers, and Sage, drumming her cracked nails against a rusted radiator. The world seemed endless here, echoing with nostalgia and untold stories. The silence between them was not uncomfortable; it was the woven quiet of people who had grown up together, shared secrets behind the gym, confided the smallest joys and the most crushing disappointments.</p><p>Every summer since fifth grade, they’d come back to this place—a relic in the growing city. The locals called it cursed; generations of children had wandered its halls before the district chained its doors for good. But for Elyas and Sage, it was a temple: their sacred space, unchanged while life outside spun faster and faster.</p><p>This summer, though, everything was different. The world had tilted sideways—Elyas felt it in the way Sage’s voice shook when she called his name, or how sunlight never quite seemed warm anymore. Their group of friends had drifted away, splintering under the pressure of high school hierarchies and geographical distance. Only they remained, bound tight by something invisible.</p><p>“So…” Sage broke the silence, her voice wrapped in its usual irreverent undertone. “How’s your dad?” The paint peeled in slow shreds over her left shoulder.</p><p>Elyas wrinkled his nose and kicked at a splinter of wood. “Still at the hospital. Mom’s barely home. Guess I’m getting good at boxed macaroni.”</p><p>She grinned—a flash of impish teeth. “Soon you’ll be a gourmet chef, you keep this up.”</p><p>He let out a slow breath. “Hard to practice when you burn toast on level two.”</p><p>Their laughter bounced around the empty room, but the worry lingered. Every time Elyas’s father fell sick, uncertainty threatened to crush him. Sage, though, had an unnerving way of making things lighter.</p><p>“So,” Sage said, suddenly serious, “let’s do one more. One last quest before we get too old for this.”</p><p>“What, like last summer?” Elyas hesitated. Last summer, Sage had convinced him to climb the gym roof during a thunderstorm. Their laughter had rivaled the thunder, reckless and alive, as they watched lightning skip across the skyline.</p><p>“Not climbing,” she replied, eyes shining. “Something more dangerous.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>She knelt down, pulling her faded backpack in front of her, and unzipped it with an air of solemnity. She drew out a thick notepad, leafed through it, and held up a page. A clumsy map, charcoal scratched over faded math notes, marked an ‘X’ in a thicket near the creek.</p><p>“That old fairy tale again?” Elyas squinted, familiar with Sage’s legendary sense of the dramatic. The rumor among local kids: a time capsule hidden by a gang of schoolteachers, filled with treasures—a relic of the school’s golden years.</p><p>Sage’s eyes narrowed, challenging. “You think I’d come all this way for nothing?”</p><p>“If you found it, the whole town would talk.”</p><p>“Exactly.” She offered her pinky, as she had since they were eight, the final and binding oath. He gripped it, and for a heartbeat, it felt as though no time had passed at all.</p><hr><p>Navigating the maze of their childhood haunts brought a cascade of memories—chasing after soccer balls under a sun-shot sky, dodging the janitor after hours, the fluttering fear of breaking the rules. The world outside buzzed with urgent futures: college applications, grown-up jobs, new beginnings. But here, on the edge of the old woods, they were just Elyas and Sage again.</p><p>The trail, overgrown with knotweed and wild grass, sloped into a familiar dip. They paused at the gnarled oak tree where, two summers prior, they’d scratched their initials. Sage’s initials had new scars over them—not carved by time, but by someone’s knife. Elyas reached out, running his fingers over the grooves.</p><p>“Let’s hurry,” Sage whispered.</p><p>Beneath the summer canopy, the world was cast in green and gold. They maneuvered through briars as robins called overhead. Sage checked the map, turning it once, squinting, then nodding. “Northwest, six paces.”</p><p>Elyas did the counting. He paused at a moss-lined boulder and knelt, searching for loose soil or a broken stone. Nothing. He tried another spot, and another. Sweat formed on his brow; his shoulders ached.</p><p>“It’s not here,” he said, voice edged with frustration.</p><p>Sage, undeterred, knelt beside him. “We’ll find it. You always give up too soon.”</p><p>Their search stretched into the afternoon, sunlight slipping in shafts between the trembling leaves. Elyas’s mind wandered to the hospital—wondering if his mother remembered to eat, if his father’s cough sounded worse today. He felt exhaustion—physical, yes, but deeper, too, as though hope itself was leaking out.</p><p>Sage leaned back against a tree, her breathing measured. “Why did everyone leave?” she asked quietly.</p><p>He didn’t need to ask what she meant. Once, theirs had been a tribe: Finn, with his wild schemes; Maia, with her sharp laugh, and gentle Livvy, who always patched up their bruises. Now, Finn moved states away, Maia tangled herself with the theater kids, Livvy grew too busy for sleepovers or scavenger hunts.</p><p>“We grew up, I guess. Or got scared.”</p><p>Sage’s gaze was unwavering. “Are you scared?”</p><p>He shook his head. “Not with you.”</p><p>She smiled, faint, and pointed at the ground by his foot. “Try there.”</p><p>He knelt one more time, hands sinking into the sweet, loamy earth, and felt something cold and metallic brush his palm. His heart stuttered. Together, they scraped the soil until a battered lunchbox emerged, its hinges crusted with rust. Inside, wrapped in yellowed tissue paper, were odds and ends: a cracked marble, three faded Polaroids, a pair of teacher’s glasses, and a note, shaky with age.</p><p><em>To our favorite class: May you always find your way back to each other, no matter where life takes you.</em></p><p>Sage grinned. “Not exactly treasure,” she murmured, “but pretty good, right?”</p><p>They sat in the soft earth, passing the mementos back and forth, wrapped in the comfort of shared discovery. The moment felt quietly sacred—the kind you tuck into your memories to bring out in later years, on harder days.</p><hr><p>The weeks that followed were a blur. Elyas’s father came home, weaker, but smiling. High school resumed its noisy pace, swallowing time and attention. Worries pressed in from all sides: exams, expectations, the looming shadow of a future neither of them felt ready for.</p><p>Elyas felt the distance yawning again, wider each day. Sage’s phone calls grew shorter; she was helping her mom at work, babysitting for her neighbors, talking more about leaving town after graduation.</p><p>One icy Saturday in December, a storm snapped the city’s power, leaving highways coated in black ice. Elyas heard the news over the kitchen radio—a local kid had been hit by a car, just two streets over. He felt dread curl in his chest. He called Sage twice, no answer. Once, twice. Panic gripped him.</p><p>He pulled on his boots and braced himself against sleet. The streets were slick, empty of traffic. Elyas’s heart jackhammered as he raced to her house, lungs burning. He reached her stoop and pounded on the door. It opened, and there stood Sage—alive, unharmed, a phone charger dangling in one hand.</p><p>“Elyas, what—?”</p><p>He burst into tears. Sage, wide-eyed, pulled him inside. They sat in near-darkness, wrapped in blankets, cold hands gripping mugs of cocoa. He struggled for words, ashamed by the depth of his relief.</p><p>“I thought—” he said thickly, “I thought I lost you, too.”</p><p>She pressed her palm to his. “I’m not going anywhere. Not without you.”</p><p>They talked all night, dozing off and waking to the steady beat of wind against the windows. Fear faded. In its place was the surety they’d known since childhood: no matter what came next, they’d find their way to each other.</p><hr><p>June crept in, wild with hope and potential. Decisions loomed—colleges, jobs, distant cities. Elyas, who’d once dreaded distance, decided to chase a music scholarship across the country. Sage, brilliant and stubborn, was accepted into a competitive apprenticeship states away.</p><p>At their last night together, they returned to the old school one last time. The walls seemed smaller, the halls more forgiving. They found the oak tree again, initials now two layers deep. Sage traced the shapes, her finger trembling.</p><p>“Nervous?” she asked, voice shaky.</p><p>“Terrified.”</p><p>She grinned. “Me too. But—” She hesitated, then slipped a Polaroid from her jacket. It was the photograph they found in the time capsule: five of them, arms slung around each other, all bratty grins and shining eyes.</p><p>“We made a promise,” Sage continued. “To always find our way back. Let’s not be like everyone else.”</p><p>He took her hand, and squeezed it.</p><p>“Deal.”</p><hr><p>Years passed.</p><p>Cities changed, jobs shifted, the world moved on. They texted when loneliness crept in, called when life felt too heavy, wrote postcards just to say they’d survived another year. Sometimes, the silence between them stretched too long, brittle and dangerous. Still, every June, one of them would send a single message: <em>Ready?</em></p><p>And every June, they found their way back to the old school—a little more battered, a little wiser. They regaled each other with tales of heartbreak, triumph, and the small kindnesses that made survival possible. The world could take everything else, but not this bond, not the loyalty forged summer after summer.</p><p>One humid twilight, Elyas—now a music teacher himself—brought along his own battered lunchbox. Inside, he’d added pictures, ticket stubs, a faded red ribbon from Sage’s first recital. Sage had brought her sharp wit, her stubborn hope. Together, they buried it beneath the old oak.</p><p>“Think someone will find this?” Elyas asked, brushing the dirt from his hands.</p><p>Sage smiled, softer now. “Maybe. But it doesn’t matter. We already did.”</p><p>And as they walked back, laughter curling into the evening air, it was clear the world belonged to them, if only for a heartbeat. The bond of true friends, tested and weathered, endured—an unbreakable thread, stitched neatly through each chapter of their story.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/friendship-and-loyalty/>Friendship and Loyalty</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-bond-of-friendship-stories-of-true-devotion/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Bond of Friendship: Stories of True Devotion</span>
