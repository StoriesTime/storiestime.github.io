The suit’s chrono blinked seventeen days since his last gravity, and still, he drifted between constellations like a wayward memory. All around, the void whispered with the detritus of history—fragments of ships, shards of bone and metal, lingering echoes of languages only machines remembered.</p><p>He adjusted the graviton borers that kept his pod tethered to the ghostly remains of this colossal worldship, a derelict twice the length of Ceres and riddled with punctures. He’d named it Delphos, after some ancient myth of prophecy—a joke, since every civilization crossing the black seemed to have perished without warning or sense. No prophecies had saved the Delphians. Their gods, if they’d had them, were as expired as the air recirculator in his sternhold.</p><p>Yahrin catalogued. That was his task and his calling, to pluck meaning from ruin. Now, as his pod’s lights flickered against the superstructure’s hull, his scanner pulsed faintly—reading the odd isotopes, the faint energy ghosts outlining a path inward. Somewhere in the metal veins of this behemoth, there were stories left to suss out.</p><p>The entry hatch screeched open, spilling a coil of ice that shattered like glass. Yahrin inched forward, mag-boots suiting every movement with ponderous caution. He floated through ruptured corridors, his beam illuminating hieroglyphics scrawled along the passage walls: trees branching, eyes weeping, spirals coiling into infinity. Language? Art? He recorded everything for Olga, the linguistics AI back on his carrier. Every expedition was a brick in the temple of futility, but habit—hope?—demanded rigor.</p><p><em>Seventeen civilizations catalogued. Seventeen voids. Seventeen thousand questions.</em></p><p>Further in, gravity’s ghost brushed against him, a gentle nudge where rotation might still operate. He found the central atrium by chasing faint magnetism, pipes shuddering under his step. In the heart of the ship: a garden, or the remains of one—a forest petrified by vacuum trauma, crystalline trunks thrusting like the ribs of a god, leaves burst to glass shivs. Silence shattered only by the crackle of his comm and the slow chirr of his own heartbeat.</p><p>He knelt, brushing detritus from a bench patterned with curling filigree—an indecipherable mosaic twisting through scenes of vast cities and winged ships. The Delphians had loved beauty, or perhaps obsession, judging by the detail. <em>Did they wonder what would become of them? Did they sense the darkness already gathering?</em></p><p>Yahrin’s proximity alert rattled. He froze. From somewhere deeper within the wreck, power pulsed, followed by a distant, ponderous thump. Hull settling? Or something waking up?</p><p>He activated his modular drone. It zipped up, painting the atrium in overlapping lines of data. A heat signature. Subtle. Repeating. He kept the gun in his glove holster hidden—last time, on Kinu-5, he’d barely survived a clutch of rabid maintenance bots, loyal to a dead master.</p><p>He inched toward the signature, each step a silent prayer. The room on the periphery flared to dull life, walls pulsing with a memory of blue-white light. Patterns glimmered—threads of information woven like digital silk.</p><p>In the center of the chamber, hunched over a slab of transparent material, was a figure—organic, lithe, but ancient, as though hewn from obsidian and starlight. Its head lifted, two multifaceted eyes reflecting the memory of entire galaxies.</p><p>Yahrin’s suit trembled. The being watched him, but made no move, apparently resigned. He transmitted his standard greeting in a dozen dead tonalities: radio clicks, holo-projectors, light pulses. The creature replied not with language, but with a motif—a ripple through the slab, an ancient sequence encoded in light.</p><p>The slab spat images: cities rising like glass tendrils, people dancing round twin moons, great ships plunging through hyperspatial gates. Then flames. Then darkness. Then, the slow, deliberate unraveling of time. A catastrophe rendered in abstraction but heavy with emotion. Yahrin stepped closer, feeling younger and older all at once.</p><p>“I study lost worlds,” his translator croaked out. It felt foolish, comically small.</p><p>The being responded with silence, except for the light. It stilled, then produced a capsule—fist-sized, made of some ink-black material that drank the glow around it. It rolled the object across the slab and waited.</p><p>Yahrin’s hand shook as he took it. His sensor array trilled at nearly impossible readings—quantum states, memory encoding at the atomic scale. This was no mere relic. <em>A message, perhaps. A history. A warning?</em></p><p>The being’s eyes settled on the capsule, then on the mosaics in the garden beyond, then back to Yahrin. It lifted an elongated hand and slowly, almost gently, pointed to the stars visible through a shattered bulkhead. Then, as softly as night in nebulae, it lay down on the derelict floor, its form losing coherence. In seconds, it crumbled into a shower of particles—no corpse, not even dust, just an echo in the electromagnetic spectrum.</p><p>He stood motionless for a time, the capsule heavy in his gloves. The stories he’d cataloged so far, carved from ruins and debris, had always been one-sided—a monologue to the void. Here, in this forgotten garden wedged between epochs, he’d been given something else: not just records, but a living link. Yet it came wrapped in more mystery than disclosure.</p><p>**</p><p>Yahrin returned to his pod and slipped free of the Delphos. As his engines shunted him back toward the research carrier, his mind returned to that final gesture the being had made—a slow arc pointing through the hull breach, finger trembling toward the galactic core, where the stars shuddered in dense, lurid knots. Drifting. Calling.</p><p>He activated the capsule in quarantine, letting his science team and their menagerie of synthetics stare and mutter as the artifact hummed with latent possibilities. Anchoring it in a field of quantum foam, he coaxed the capsule open.</p><p>Data. Baleful, complex, and achingly elegant. It poured forth across multiple dimensions—photonic, acoustic, tactile. The Delphian record was a tapestry. Cultures rose and fell on worlds that orbit now-lost stars, entire planets converted into thinking beings, webs of consciousness stretching between clusters, their aspirations stamped on the heart of the Milky Way.</p><p>Yahrin’s chronologers dissected the information, finding themes as old as sentience itself: triumph, despair, love, annihilation. The Delphians had not simply vanished—they had scattered, retreating before the rising tide of something ancient and devouring. A void with many names, none precise, hunting civilizations like a wolf in the underbrush of time.</p><p>Still, hope speckled their self-portrait. Even as darkness closed, seeds had been dispersed—a network of beacons, messages stashed in cometary nuclei and asteroid hearts, waiting for someone to listen. He saw the Delphian symbol everywhere: a hand outstretched, a path winding forward.</p><p>Project <em>Stellar Drift</em> was born in the afterglow of that transmission, Yahrin’s mission mutating into obsession. He hunted Delphian markers: caches of memory, dark matter libraries, moons transformed into memorials. Each find added links to the cipher, mapping a civilization against the backdrop of its eclipse. Some missions were simple—recovering datacores or transmitting lost art back to crowds of eager archivists. Others ran darker. On the comet <em>Ishtar’s Veil</em>, he nearly lost himself to an echo of Delphian rage, a security protocol gone mad, infecting his suit’s neural interface.</p><p>He nearly abandoned the search more than once. The weight of so much history pressed down until breathing became hard and hope a liability. Yet he pressed on, guided by glimpses of other searchers—a garbled beacon from a distant polity, a scavenger’s log hinting at a Delphian artifact, a child&rsquo;s drawing sent from a habitat two thousand lightyears distant, the Delphian hand gently encouraging hope.</p><p>With each new clue pieced together, his understanding grew: the final message was not just a warning, but an invitation. “History,” the last transmission said in brilliant, polyphonic harmonics, “is not only loss, but the perpetual creation of meaning. Our ruins are not graves—they are seeds. Will you answer the question we never managed to ask?”</p><p>Yahrin answered, mixing his voice with theirs, launching new capsules into the dark—each containing fragments of himself, his world, his people’s mistakes and triumphs. Sometimes, years later, echoes came back: a whisper from another seeker, a faint resonance in distant stellar wind. The chain lengthened. The delphic trail wound on.</p><p>The galaxy spun its slow, oblivious dance. Stars lived and died. Civilizations drifted and vanished, but in the labyrinth of ruin and possibility, new stories ignited. For each lost world, another dreamed; for each silent void, a record, a question, a hope—launched into the cosmic drift, waiting for wonder to find it.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/science-fiction/>Science Fiction</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/starlight-rebellion-the-fight-for-freedom-in-space/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Starlight Rebellion: The Fight for Freedom in Space</span>
