Rain glistened across asphalt, turning streetlights into hazy halos. Cass leaned against the cold stone of the First Metropolitan’s east wall, fingertips drumming on the gritty ledge. In the alley behind her, a battered blue van idled quietly, paint peeling along the rails. Every detail had been planned, every move rehearsed, but none of them—not Cass, not Milo, not sweet-natured Ike or brittle, smart-mouthed Lana—could see beyond the next ten minutes. That was banking on fate, and fate had a habit of double-charging those who tried to cash out.</p><p>She checked her watch—old, gold, a relic from her mother. Two minutes ahead of schedule. Her breath fogged. In the van, Milo studied his phone—schematics, security rotations, streets. Ike lifted a duffle bag, checked the weight, and zipped it back. Lana fiddled with her earpiece. The air buzzed, thick with the kind of tension that made time fracture.</p><p>Cass pressed the comm. “Timing?”</p><p>Milo’s voice crackled. “All clear, minus the night guard. Just switched. We’re on.”</p><p>She nodded, wiped her palms on her jeans, and motioned forward. The heist wasn’t supposed to be poetic, but there was a strange beauty to it—a ballet of nerves, loyalty, desperation. Four people, all running from one thing and straight into another.</p><p>They hustled across the sopping pavement, shadows folding over them. Cass’s lockpick vibrated along the old steel, tumblers dropping in sequence. The heavy door gave with a wet sigh. They slipped inside, masks down, nerves high.</p><p>The lobby was all marble, glass, and chrome—designed to intimidate, to impress. Tonight, it only amplified echoes: footsteps, muffled breath, an anxious cough from Ike. Milo led, ducking low as he bypassed the main alarm with code after code. Lana kept watch from the rear, pistol raised, gaze sharp and jittery.</p><p>They reached the vault corridor in sixty-five breathless seconds. Cass took point, drilling the number pad—codes memorized, palms sweating. Milo’s timer whirred—ninety seconds to bypass the auxiliary lockdown. A slip and the silent alarm would ping.</p><p>She pressed in the numbers, turned the handles, and moved aside for Milo. He hunched over the panel, gloved fingers dancing over wires. Lana braced herself, humming under her breath, a sharp counterpoint to the clock’s pulse.</p><p>Ike’s voice, barely a whisper. “C’mon, Milo, almost there…”</p><p>A loud <em>pop</em>. Milo cursed, sparks dancing from the box. The lights flickered. For a heartbeat, everything was chaos—shouts, scrambling hands, a blaring alarm that shouldn’t have existed on the blueprints. Lana barked, “Security, three minutes tops,” then spun as footsteps thudded down a back hall.</p><p>Cass didn’t hesitate. She yanked the vault’s secondary handle, praying for play in the mechanism. It stuttered, ground, then gave—a four-inch gap. She wedged her crowbar into the seam, forcing space enough for Ike’s wiry frame. He dove through, bag first, then hands. Cass hissed, “One minute or we’re fried.”</p><p>Inside, the vault was colder than the world outside. Ike yanked open safety deposit boxes—a dance of clinking, clattering, grabbing stacks of bundled bills, velvet boxes, envelopes marked with indecipherable codes. In thirty seconds, he had what they could carry.</p><p>Back outside, security lights stuttered to life. Lana’s pistol snapped toward the corridor, Milo’s snarl echoing as a pair of guards rounded the corner. Cass vaulted the counter, upending Plexiglas and sending a rain of credit slips fluttering.</p><p>“Go, go, go—” Milo shouted, and they tore down the hall, pounds thrown in every direction.</p><p>Outside, the rain hadn’t let up. It hammered the roof in a furious rhythm. Cass reached the van first, keys ready, door yanked wide.</p><p>But Milo wasn’t there. Ike hauled Lana inside. “Where’s Milo?” Cass hissed.</p><p>Shots snapped through the air—sharp, echoing ricochets. Lana howled and surged forward, gun up, wild-eyed. Milo staggered into view, clutching his shoulder, blood seeping down his sleeve.</p><p>“They got me,” he gasped, half-collapsing as he made it to the van. Ike and Cass pulled him up, Lana slamming the sliding door shut. Sirens whined in the distance, multiplying like insects in the heat of the moment.</p><p>Cass floored it, tires screeching into the wet. Milo hissed, Lana fired a round back at the shadow-drenched figures, and Ike pressed a hoodie onto Milo’s wounded arm. No one spoke as they threaded through the city, rain turning the windshield into a spinning roulette of neon and shadow.</p><hr><p>They floored it for the safehouse on 12th—a ramshackle third-floor loft above a discount mattress store. Cass slammed the van into park, Lana hauled the loot with shaking arms. Milo stumbled upstairs, each step a shot of pain. Inside, Ike fished out gauze from an ancient first-aid kit, hands trembling as he bound the wound.</p><p>“Bullet’s still in there,” he muttered.</p><p>Milo gritted his teeth. “It can stay. We got out.”</p><p>They dumped the bags onto the stained carpet, breathing hard. Cash, jewelry, random slips of paper—some useless, some priceless. Lana peeled off her mask, thick braids plastered to her forehead.</p><p>“That was supposed to be clean! There wasn’t—there weren’t supposed to be that many guards,” she spat.</p><p>Cass sagged into a chair, jaw clenched. “Something was wrong. The alarm—he said it wouldn’t be wired in. Blueprints didn’t match reality. Milo, what the hell?”</p><p>Milo’s face twisted—anger, guilt, fear a muddied mess. “I checked. I double-checked. They must’ve changed the system after we cased the place.”</p><p>Ike stared at the loot, then at his trembling hands. “We do this, we’re done. No more jobs, no more running?”</p><p>Cass’s laugh was thin, tired. “That was the last bank job. Either we’re rich tomorrow, or dead by midnight.”</p><p>For a moment, nobody moved. The city pressed close, sirens winding through distant streets, the rain an unending metronome. Milo groaned, sweat beading on his ashen face. Lana busied herself dividing the take, hands sure even as her eyes glittered with tears she refused to shed.</p><p>Cass stared at the loot—the sum of everything they’d risked. Was it worth the blood running through the floorboards? Would it ever be enough?</p><hr><p>Sleep never came for Cass that night. She watched over Milo’s fitful rest, heard the rain easing after dawn. The television in the corner flickered with news: “Botched robbery at First Metropolitan—three suspects at large. Security officer wounded. Police urge the public to remain vigilant.”</p><p>Faces faded on the screen—too grainy for real danger. But Cass knew the city. Stories changed quickly, people even faster.</p><p>By morning, plans were forming. Lana slipped out with a slice of their take, hunting for forged passports. Ike, grim-faced, loaded the cash into backpacks.</p><p>Milo, pale and exhausted, squeezed Cass’s hand. “You did your part,” he breathed. “You kept us alive.”</p><p>Cass shook her head. “Not all of us. The guard—he’s lying in a hospital or worse.”</p><p>Guilt rode their shoulders heavier than the loot ever could.</p><hr><p>The fallout was a slow unraveling.</p><p>They split, one by one. Lana left at midday, moving like a ghost with her backpack slung high. Ike took the service elevator out, vanishing into city crowds. Milo stayed till sunset, face pinched, pain shadowing his every move.</p><p>Cass remained in the near-dark, rainless silence, staring at the empty bags and the cheap folding chair by the window. Outside, life resumed: taxis crawled by, businesspeople forced umbrellas against the drizzle. In the distance, a siren wailed for the injured and the guilty alike.</p><p>Cass kept her face from the glass. She didn’t need to see what came next—a wave of blue uniforms stomping through the wreck of their hideout, or the endless questions she’d never answer. Instead, she remembered Milo’s laugh in quieter days, Lana’s stubborn hope, Ike’s silent loyalty.</p><p>The last bank job was never about the money. It was about what you were willing to lose—or, in the end, what you managed to keep.</p><p>And for Cass, with sunlight sliding pale and thin through a smudged window pane, it wasn’t much. But it was enough to remind her: this city never loved you back, but it at least remembered you were here.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/robbery-and-heists/>Robbery and Heists</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-inside-man-secrets-of-a-corporate-heist/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Inside Man: Secrets of a Corporate Heist</span>
