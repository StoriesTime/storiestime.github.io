Once a quaint village nestled between rolling hills, it was now a fractured memory of homes and lives lost. The air was heavy, saturated with the remnants of violence, the kind that did not leave physical scars, but scars that would last a lifetime.</p><p>Eva stood at the edge of what was once a bustling marketplace. Her eyes, still vacant and hollow from the trauma of the previous days, scanned the remains of her home. Her legs felt heavy, like each step was an echo of the last, a hollow reminder of what had been stolen from her. Her hands trembled as she reached for the remnants of a broken window frame, the jagged edges of glass embedded deep in her palm, but she didn’t flinch. Pain had become a constant companion.</p><p>Eva had heard the stories of war, but no one had ever warned her about its silence. The kind of silence that stretched out endlessly, leaving her alone with her thoughts, her grief, and the relentless replay of the atrocities she had witnessed. No one had warned her that the worst scars would be the ones she couldn’t see. The trauma that lingered long after the smoke had cleared, the kind that gnawed at the soul and turned the mind into a battlefield of its own.</p><hr><p>The war had come to Avni without warning. At first, there had been whispers—small rumblings in the distance, the muffled thuds of explosions that seemed so far away. But it didn’t take long for the violence to creep closer, inching toward them like an inevitable tide. The people of Avni had always been a close-knit community, bound by shared history and a deep-rooted sense of belonging. But the war had shattered those bonds, leaving people scattered and broken, like fragments of a once-immaculate mosaic.</p><p>Eva’s brother, Luka, had enlisted when the call for soldiers had come. He had been just 19, with bright eyes and an infectious laugh that seemed to lift the spirits of everyone around him. She could still remember the last time she saw him, standing at the doorstep, wearing the uniform of a soldier. He had smiled, though there had been a sadness in his eyes that she hadn’t fully understood at the time.</p><p>“I’ll be back, Eva,” Luka had said, his voice steady, though she could hear the uncertainty hidden in his words. “I’ll be back, and when I do, we’ll rebuild together.”</p><p>She had believed him then, with the naïveté only a sister could have. But in the end, Luka never came back. The letter had come a month later, written in shaky, uneven handwriting, telling her that Luka had been caught in an ambush, that there was no hope. And yet, there had been no body to bury. No closure to bring peace. Just a letter. A piece of paper that didn’t make sense and only made the silence louder.</p><p>Eva’s life had been in a constant state of dissonance since that day. On one hand, she wanted to remember her brother as the vibrant, full-of-life young man he had been, but on the other, the memory of his absence weighed heavily on her heart. The pain of not knowing how he had died, or where, became something that occupied her every waking thought.</p><hr><p>But it wasn’t just Luka. Eva wasn’t the only one left in the wake of the war&rsquo;s chaos. In the days that followed, she found herself surrounded by others who carried their own grief, each of them struggling to make sense of a world that no longer felt safe, no longer felt like home.</p><p>There was Amina, the widow who had lost her husband, Niko, to an airstrike. Amina had never been the same since. She was a shadow of the woman she had once been—her face gaunt, her eyes hollow, her hands twitching uncontrollably. Eva had tried to reach out to her, to offer solace, but Amina had become a specter, disconnected from the world around her. Sometimes, late at night, Eva would hear her crying from her half-collapsed house, but there was nothing she could do.</p><p>There was also Miko, a boy no older than 15, who had once been her neighbor. He had grown up with her, playing in the fields and running through the streets with the other children of Avni. Miko’s family had been lost to a bombing raid, and when he had returned to the village in the aftermath, he was different. His eyes no longer held the innocent curiosity that had once made him such a bright boy. They were now vacant, detached, as though a part of him had died with his parents.</p><p>At first, Miko had tried to speak of his losses, but the words never came. He would sit in the rubble of his home, his gaze fixed on the distant horizon, as if waiting for something—anything—to make sense of the chaos. But there was nothing. And Eva found herself wondering if there ever would be.</p><hr><p>For days, Eva wandered through the remains of Avni, watching as the village began to slowly fade into memory. There were no more smiles, no more laughter. The air, once filled with the sounds of children’s voices and the hum of daily life, was now stifled by the weight of grief. The world had moved on, as it always did in times of war. But Eva couldn’t move on. She couldn’t forget. She couldn’t ignore the ghost of the past that lingered at every corner.</p><p>And yet, in the midst of it all, there was something even darker—a quiet force that seemed to stretch its tendrils into her soul, one she couldn’t escape. It was the trauma. The trauma that clung to her like a shadow, that whispered in her ears long after the bombs had stopped falling. It wasn’t just the death. It wasn’t just the destruction. It was the silence—the hollow, suffocating silence that remained long after the violence had subsided.</p><p>Eva could still hear it: the screams of her brother, the cries of her neighbors, the echoes of a world that had once been whole. But the screams weren’t loud anymore. They were soft, muted, as though trapped behind an invisible barrier that she couldn’t break through. She could feel them deep within her chest, lodged in her lungs, in her heart, in the very marrow of her bones. The silent scream of a generation lost.</p><hr><p>In the days that followed, Eva began to notice something strange: she was no longer alone in her grief. It was as though the village itself had absorbed the trauma of the war, and the souls of those who had been lost were still present, walking among the living, lingering in the air.</p><p>One evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a crimson glow across the sky, Eva found herself standing by the old well at the center of the village. It was a place she used to visit with Luka, where they would play games and share stories. But now, the well was a silent, mournful relic, its waters tainted with the residue of the war. She ran her fingers along the stone edge, her mind lost in thought, when suddenly, she felt a presence behind her.</p><p>It was Miko. His face was expressionless, his eyes empty.</p><p>“They’re still here,” he whispered, his voice a hollow murmur. “I can feel them, Eva. All of them. The ones we lost. They’re still here. In the silence.”</p><p>Eva turned to face him, her heart sinking. She wanted to tell him that it wasn’t possible, that the dead couldn’t return, that the war had taken enough already. But the words never came. Instead, she simply stood there, watching as Miko’s gaze drifted past her, his mind seemingly lost in the same haunting void that had consumed them all.</p><p>“They won’t ever leave,” Miko continued, his voice breaking. “Not until we do.”</p><p>Eva didn’t know what to say. The weight of his words hung in the air, thick and suffocating. The trauma of the war had not just shattered their bodies; it had shattered their very souls, leaving them in a limbo between life and death.</p><p>As the days turned into weeks, Eva began to understand. The trauma of war wasn’t something that could be healed. It was something that stayed with you, something that became a part of you, woven into the very fabric of your existence. The pain didn’t go away. It didn’t fade. It lingered in the quiet, in the silence between the moments. It was the silent scream of those who had been left behind, those whose voices had been drowned out by the violence and chaos of war.</p><p>Eva no longer sought closure. She no longer sought peace. She had come to accept that war’s scars would never truly heal, that the silence would always be there. And so, she learned to live with it, to carry the weight of it on her shoulders, like everyone else who had survived. For in the end, the silent scream was the only voice that remained—echoing through the ruins of Avni, through the broken lives of its people, and through the memories of all that had been lost.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/war-and-conflict/>War and Conflict</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-silent-cry-of-trenches/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Silent Cry of Trenches</span>
