The kingdom was at peace, but the whispers of dissent had begun to circulate among the nobles and the people. William, Duke of Normandy, had been gathering his forces in secret, biding his time until the perfect moment to strike. That moment arrived on October 14, 1066, when King Edward of England died, sparking a battle for succession that would change the course of history.
The Norman Army
William, Duke of Normandy, stood atop Senlac Hill, gazing out at the vast expanse of his army. Knights, men-at-arms, and archers stretched as far as the eye could see, their armor glinting in the early morning sunlight. Among them rode the most feared warriors of the time: the Norman cavalry. Each man had been handpicked by William himself, and they knew that victory was within their grasp.
Below, the Saxon army watched them with a mixture of fear and contempt. Harold Godwinson, a former king and a battle-hardened warrior, had rallied his troops with a fiery speech. They had marched from the farthest reaches of England to take on the Norman invaders and defend their homeland. In the chill of the English morning air, they stood ready for battle.
The English Army
The Saxon army, bolstered by the presence of their king, held a tight formation. Mercian, Wessex, and East Anglian warriors stood shoulder to shoulder, their shields locked in a defensive wall. The infantry was supported by the housecarls – tall, heavily armored men-at-arms who could break the enemy lines. In the rear, the fyrd – reserve troops from all corners of England – waited to make a crucial difference in the outcome of the battle.
The Battle Begins
The battle raged on, with clashes of steel on steel echoing across the landscape. Norman cavalry, expert in the art of jousting, charged into the fray, arrows and lances at the ready. The English lines held, but cracks began to show. William's forces, better trained and better equipped than the English, gradually gained ground.
The Saxon stronghold of the shield wall began to waver under the relentless onslaught. Bodies piled high, and the cries of the wounded reached a deafening pitch. William's Normans pushed forward, their disciplined formation conserving strength for the final blow.
The Turning Point
As the battle wore on, the Norman archers took position on a small hill, raining arrows on the English lines. Their heavy arrows broke through the shield wall, leaving the Saxon warriors exposed and vulnerable to the pounding of the Norman cavalry. In a brutal, fiery encounter, the English lines buckled under the sheer weight of the enemy attack.
King Harold fell on Senlac Hill, his legendary war-axe shattered. With their leader gone, the English army lost heart, and the battle rapidly turned in favor of the Normans. They laid siege to the Saxon stronghold, psyching out the warriors until the gates opened. The Norman invasion, now absolute, claimed Hastings.
Epilogue
Four days later, on October 18, 1066, French-speaking clerks documented the Norman victory. William, Duke of Normandy, was crowned William I of England. England's intricate feudal system and a little of the island's fierce free spirit changed irrevocably on that wind-whipped and beaten hill in the decrentive _ Battle of Hastings._
