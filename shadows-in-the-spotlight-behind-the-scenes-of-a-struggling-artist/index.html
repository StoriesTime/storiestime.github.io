She wasn&rsquo;t the type to romanticize nightmarish reality, crying over her days without a proper gallery or genuine recognition. Alexa was a realist, and in her world, she painted what she saw: shadows in the spotlight. The behind-the-scenes side of the art world was her canvas, her brush strokes sharp and bitter.</p><p>As she walked the tightrope between desperately waiting for the call from that one gallery to represent her and constant unwavering determination, one could pity Alexa. But pity wasn&rsquo;t something she welcomed or indulged in. No, she&rsquo;d had her pity party long ago, a solitary affair where she drank coffee, listened to melancholic tunes, and contemplated leaving the whole charade behind.</p><p>But then again, what would become of her if not for it?</p><p>She&rsquo;d inherited the gift of painting from her mother, a woman who made it look like breathing, effortless finesse. Alexa&rsquo;s mother, Eleanor, had seen her share of the limelight, the accolades and recognition, before disappearing one day, from Alexa&rsquo;s life as well as the art world. Alexa had barely known her to reappear. But enough to know art was in her blood.</p><p>Alexa opened the door to her cluttered apartment, the scent of stale coffee mingling with the unmistakable odor of turpentine that clung to her skin. The ochre glow from the setting sun stained the clouds outside her window as she rummaged through her paintings stacked haphazardly on the floor. Each one a testament to her mental submission to that unspoken suffering artists grappled with. She chose a portrait covering a makeshift wall, tattered cardboard and masking tape holding it together. Aesthetically, it wasn&rsquo;t her best, but it vibrated with raw emotion she could never quite get rid of. She slapped it into her old, worn-out leather bag and stepped out into the labyrinthine streets of the city that never slept.</p><p>The salon hour was in full swing, museum curator Elaine Travers&rsquo;s annual birthday bash. Alexa entered reluctantly, her glance sneaking into the gathering masquerade where the art world&rsquo;s elite mingled in their impeccable finery. Elaine&rsquo;s exhibitions held power, but she also held grudges. To sit on her guest list could mean either, breakthrough or banishment.</p><p>No one recognized her at first, and for a moment, Alexa thought to slip away unnoticed. But the evening air was pregnant with expectancy, and she allowed herself to be carried along this twist in her fate. A waiter passed by, and she accepted a glass of champagne. It was dry, unlike her usual taste of sweet, cloying confectionery that comforted her when the world felt like it crumbled around her, but she sipped it, welcoming it.</p><p>She walked over to a sofa conversation nest, merging into the chattering minds occupied by her stories turning into barbs. &ldquo;Did you see the Fernandez twins? Their last collection is nothing but outlandish clichés. Just look at Jaqueline&rsquo;s purple hair, if you please,&rdquo; a woman with a Spanish accent droned, ignoring Alexa&rsquo;s pleading glance for an exit. Alexa had once been Jacqueline&rsquo;s age. Another year wouldn&rsquo;t hurt. She slipped away.</p><p>In the courtyard, an open-air gallery housed works in varying mediums. Across the room, Vanessa Mark disarmed an admirer&rsquo;s serious appraisal of her avant-garde sculpture. Her rainbows of neon lights threatened to instigate epileptic seizures, but her coy smiles and languid gestures silenced naysayers.</p><p>Cloaked in semi-darkness, a painting caught Alexa&rsquo;s eye – a swirling black vortex shimmering with stars, a door to a parallel universe. She edged closer, the art consume her, the push and pull of awe and envy clutch at her throat. She knew the artist, Zara Foxwood, a skeptic with a silver tongue able to articulate love for the intangible.</p><p>&ldquo;Hardly the gothic resurrection piece the critics sought from you, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Alexa said, stepping into the cone of light thrown by a spotlight.</p><p>Zara turned, eyes widening as recognition dawned. Her painted lips curled into a big smile. &ldquo;Ah, your observation sends a shiver down my&mldr; well, not spine. That would be cliché.&rdquo;</p><p>They fell into familiar silence, broken by choked laughter from the invisible audience. Just then, the crowd ebbed in Elaine&rsquo;s direction. Chatter over the upcoming exhibit spilled out, and Alexa caught the crimson name-tagged phrase: &lsquo;The Triumph of Confusion.&rsquo; Her heart leaped into her throat; it could&rsquo;ve been her, it should&rsquo;ve been her.</p><p>&ldquo;Looks like Elaine is at it again,&rdquo; Zara drawled, her arm lazily draped over her painting.</p><p>&ldquo;What on earth could she mean by that?&rdquo; Alexa said, scarcely hearing her own question. But she persisted.</p><p>&ldquo;You know, the Joan of Art.&rdquo; Zara&rsquo;s lips curled into a wicked, knowing smile. &ldquo;Backstabbing and single-handedly decimating careers all in the name of escalating her personal empire. It comes with the territory, darling.&rdquo;</p><p>Alexa accepted her grim prognosis silently, her mind formulating strategies, calculating the odds. A teacher at a poorly funded art school had once warned her about a harsh reality she found too painful: &ldquo;One day, you&rsquo;ll feel the click of the final door closing on you. But as long as your spirit doesn&rsquo;t crumble, it&rsquo;s just a momentary setback.&rdquo;</p><p>Elaine&rsquo;s dominance could freeze the competition, but it could never fully smother that passion. Resignation battled with determination. Resignation won.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go, she whispered, already walking away, &ldquo;Tomorrow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mm-hmm, Alexa. And tomorrow, and tomorrow,&rdquo; Zara agreed, lips betraying a skeleton grin.</p><p>Back in her shrouded lair, she removed the portrait she&rsquo;d carried, armoring her emotional fortress. The painting was too raw, too close, a bittersweet reminder of a lonely existence unworthy of daylight. That painting was forbidden, and so she hid it.</p><p>But perhaps the human spirit was therapeutic, as rumored. Led by curiosity or desperate hope, Alexa dabbed her brush into the palette, coating it with an ardent red. She hesitated, overwhelmed by thoughts that threatened her undoing. But the stubbornness of artists everywhere, a sort of defiance, insisted she persist.</p><p>She drew her breath, focusing on her canvas, and the first stroke of rebellion began: the heady mélange of scarlet flesh and sinew, a stratum of muscle throbbing with breaths. This wasn&rsquo;t by accident. No, this painting was conceived on purpose, a labor of love, torment, and her real identity: a wife, a lover, a daughter, and yes, an artist.</p><p>As her hand moved frenetically, delicate, secretive yearnings made material. She painted herself in the shadows, the duality of hope and despair. For when one is crippled in despair, the light of hope would become visible only in her dwindling shadows.</p><p>When it was done, she unveiled her radiant creation, the breaking cold fear rendered insignificant by the warmth the very act of painting bewitching her into unearthing her ferocious, and unleashed soul, a Picasso in the making, enabled her. Alexa Taven immortalized her now banished, once brutal agony in a canvas, whispering to the universe, &ldquo;I exist. I belong. I&rsquo;ll forever create within the shadows of untold stories, with your spotlight.&rdquo;</p><p>And as she gazed upon her creation, she knew she&rsquo;d carry the burden of creation to her grave. She also knew that her existence would alleviate the suffocation that darkness generates.</p><p>As night cloaked over the hustle and bustle of the world below, Alexa Taven fell asleep in a seat she had conjured for herself in her solitude, and when she woke, she knew which painting to bring to Elaine Travers&rsquo;s next salon event.</p><p>For Alexa, shadows were no longer mere accessories to her existence, neither were they repressive. They had become an inseparable part of life, where her struggles gave birth to her masterpiece, her most endearing creation that gift could become her life&rsquo;s purpose. And within her purpose, she found her place.</p><p>The struggle would continue, shadows would always exist, but so would the proverbial spotlight, eventually she hoped pointing directly at her, as screams her stories of struggle and speaks the language only her soul understands, in its ceaseless search for recognition, for substance, and maybe, for love.</p><p>For that is what her existence was all about.</p><p>End of Story.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/artistic-struggles/>Artistic Struggles</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/shadowed-vision-chasing-dreams-through-frustration/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Shadowed Vision: Chasing Dreams Through Frustration</span>
