Below, slit-eyed merchants weaved their wagons through choked market lanes. Every street hummed with anxious gossip—stories of falling stars, of shadows that flit behind the teeth of the mountains, of a dragon long thought extinct stirring once more.</p><p>Seren crept up the marble steps of the Temple of Gales, clutching a bundle of scrolls and a purloined apple. Her heart thudded in rhythm with her footsteps as she pushed through the bronze doors. The air inside shimmered with incense, old paper, and the sharp tang of magic—if one knew how to listen.</p><p>At the altar, High Archivist Merrik hunched over the coins of prophecy, lips moving as he arranged gleaming disks in patterns only the initiated could translate. His eyes, ancient and fox-bright, darted up. “You’re late,” he snapped.</p><p>“Maybe the omens moved faster than I did,” Seren muttered, depositing the bundle at his feet.</p><p>He scowled. “If you wish to apprentice in our order, you’d best learn when not to jest. The stars have spoken; this city teeters on a knife’s edge.” He swept up a scroll and unfurled it in a sigh of vellum. The calligraphy coiled and danced, lines rearranging themselves into intricate forms.</p><p>Seren peered closer. “That’s not—wait. Those are dragon runes.”</p><p>“Correct. The last time these rearranged, the old King fell. Now, they promise something far darker.” He met her gaze—sudden, fierce. “I must visit the archives beneath the Vaulted Hill. You will seek out the Runeseer.” Merrik pressed a carved obsidian token into her hand. “Ask her what the prophecy wants of us.”</p><p>Seren blinked. “You mean the witch in the wildwood?”</p><p>“She may be many things. Today, she is your only answer.”</p><p>She nodded, throat dry. No one returned unchanged from the wildwood.</p><hr><p>The morning slipped through the city as Seren traversed winding alleys and crossed shadowed courtyards. She passed through the outer gates, where pale-eyed guards sneered at her city-bred boots. The landscape beyond shuddered with silence, mist veiling small hollows and twisted trees.</p><p>The wildwood did not welcome visitors. Branches grasped at her cloak; roots angled to trip the unwary. The path narrowed until only animal tracks marked the dew. Just when she thought hopelessness would bury her resolve, she found herself facing a cottage—its roof thick with luminous moss, its door painted with dancing scales.</p><p>An old woman, hair like spun moonlight, awaited her on a three-legged stool.</p><p>“You seek the future, little one?” The Runeseer’s voice was a melody riddled with secrets.</p><p>Seren nodded, presenting the obsidian token. “The prophecy has changed,” she managed. “Eldros trembles. We need to know its will.”</p><p>The Runeseer beckoned her close. “You must see what lies beneath riddles and ash.”</p><p>They sat amid a cluster of mushrooms. The witch smeared a mixture of sap and soot on Seren’s brow, chanted words saucy and strange. The world flexed—colors bloomed, then peeled away.</p><p>Suddenly, Seren stood atop a mountain’s edge. The sky split asunder, scorching dragons winged through stormclouds, scales obsidian and silver. One, colossal and ancient, dwarfed the rest. Beneath its gaze, cities toppled, rivers boiled away. Its eyes—amber, all knowing—fixed on her.</p><p><em>“You bear the brand of both doom and hope. The chosen bonds the end to the beginning.”</em></p><p>Seren gasped as the vision ebbed, the cottage knitting itself around her once more.</p><p>The Runeseer pressed a crystal shard into Seren’s palm, warm as a newborn chick. “The dragon seeks what was stolen from it—the Stone of Stars. Without it, none in Eldros survive the coming fire. Find it or perish.”</p><p>Seren’s resolve hardened. She could run home, cower behind city walls, or hunt the Stone that spelled salvation or annihilation. Still dazed, she bowed and began the return to Eldros, the world suddenly heavier, the oaths of the old kindling in her chest.</p><hr><p>Rumors snapped at her heels as she crossed Eldros’ threshold. Panic hung in the square air—strange lights from the mountains, livestock turned to glass, a sky that seethed between blue and blood.</p><p>Archivist Merrik awaited her at the temple, gaze bright as a storm.</p><p>“Tell me.”</p><p>Seren recounted the vision, the voice of the dragon, the warning. She offered the crystal. Merrik turned it in the sunbeam, face stricken. “The Stone was lost with the shattered Order, two centuries ago. Only the Circle of Wyrmkeepers recall its hiding place—if any remain alive.”</p><p>A plan unfurled, as wild and perilous as the dawn. Seren would seek the Circle.</p><hr><p>The Circle’s last living halls clung to the face of Mount Selen, mantled in writhing cloud. No map could guide her, only old tales stitched through bard’s songs and the whispered warnings of fleeing shepherds.</p><p>The climb stripped flesh and memory. Bitter winds cut her cheeks raw, needles of ice wormed through leather and thought. At last, a torch flickered high above—a passage cut in stone, guarded by silent sigils.</p><p>Inside, nine figures waited in a mourning circle. Their faces reflected the mountain—ancient, weathered, remote.</p><p>“We wondered when you would come.” The tallest, cloaked in sapphire scales, rose. “You seek the Stone.”</p><p>Seren detailed the prophecy. When she described the vision, a shiver traveled the circle. Their oaths compelled them, even now.</p><p>The elder spoke: “The Stone is hidden in the Drowned Caves, far beneath the Lake of Echoes. Only dragonfire may unseal its prison. But the dragon… the last of her kind… sleeps in embittered rage. None who sought her returned.”</p><p>Something in Seren’s chest turned. “How do I wake her?”</p><p>“Bring a fragment of her past—a memory crystallized—and speak the prophecy aloud. If you survive her wrath, she may let you claim the Stone.”</p><p>She thanked them, spirit unfurling with equal parts dread and wonder.</p><hr><p>Traveling under a sky bruised with twilight, Seren descended to the Lake of Echoes. The water stretched black and glassy; only the ripple of uneasy wind disturbed its peace. Mournful voices—echoes, or lamentations of the drowned—rose from the shore.</p><p>Within a bundle wrapped in old linen, she carried the runestone entrusted by the Circle—a memory of the dragon’s lost kin, snared in fossilized amber.</p><p>She entered the cave as night folded the world silent. The air grew thick, heavy with the perfume of ancient scales and obsidian hearths. Every footstep reverberated, multiplied by the bones of giants.</p><p>Then: a heartbeat, so immense it shattered every silence.</p><p>The dragon coiled among pillars of stone. Her body seemed crafted from storm and midnight, eyes smoldering with all the ages of pain and beauty. When she moved, the world shivered.</p><p>Seren knelt, presenting the amber relic.</p><p>Great wings unfolded. “You trespass with the past, child of trembling cities.”</p><p>Seren’s voice barely held. “I come seeking hope—not for myself, but for all above. The Stone of Stars must return to the world, or life ends for us all.”</p><p>A long silence unspooled, thick with waiting.</p><p>“Speak the prophecy,” the dragon rumbled.</p><p>Seren recited the words: the city’s doom, the dragon’s awakening, the fate that bound them all. When she finished, the dragon lowered her head, tears like liquid crystal trembling beneath scaled eyelids.</p><p>“You carry the memory of my lost kin. You bear the mark of the present’s hope. I will grant you the fire to unseal the Stone—but you must carry one portion of my pain, that men may not forget.”</p><p>Agonizing heat poured down, suffusing every vein with ancient sorrow, every bone with compassion fierce as flame. Seren felt herself remade by pain and purpose.</p><p>The dragon’s breath curled around her, gentle as summer smoke. Below, a chasm split—within, a stellar light blazed from the Stone of Stars. Seren seized it, vision overflowing with worlds not yet born.</p><hr><p>When she staggered from the cave, the dragon soared above, her cry echoing over mountains and through the fevered veins of Eldros.</p><p>Seren raced to the city. The sky had cracked. A second sun—red and immense—hung on the horizon, spewing shadows and flame. People screamed, fled, fought.</p><p>She mounted the Temple of Gales, the Stone a furnace in her hands. High above, the dragon circled, exhaling a torrent of fire that parted only before Seren.</p><p>She raised the Stone. Light poured outward—tender, fierce, a song of binding and healing. Flames receded. The blood sun faded, replaced by the soft blue of peace.</p><p>The city’s defenders and cowards alike dropped to their knees, weeping. Seren felt the last ache of the dragon’s sorrow pool behind her eyes, shaping her tears.</p><p>The dragon landed with the gentleness of falling mist. “The bond holds. My pain becomes mankind’s lesson.”</p><p>Together—archivist, dragon, and the new prophet—stood atop the tower as dawn broke once again, gold blossoming on every edge.</p><hr><p>Much was rebuilt. Seren never rid herself of the dragon’s sorrow, nor sought to. Every year, on the anniversary of the prophecy, she told the tale—how pain, memory, and magic bound together all fates; how the future was always born from the flames we dared to face.</p><p>And so, the legend carried on—of a city saved by a girl with a dragon’s prophecy, and of the mythic magic that would never quite disappear from the world.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/mythology-and-legends/>Mythology and Legends</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/the-dragons-lair-unraveling-the-mysteries-of-a-mythical-creatures-abode/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Dragon's Lair: Unraveling the Mysteries of a Mythical Creature's Abode</span>
