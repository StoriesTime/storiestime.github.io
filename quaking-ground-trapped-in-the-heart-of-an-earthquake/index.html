A place where people murmured tales of ancient spirits and the undying wrath of the Earth itself. It was said that deep within its treacherous core, an ancient force slumbered, waiting for the day when its fury would rupture the bonds of reality and unleash suffering upon the world.</p><p>Seventeen-year-old Lyra Hawkins was once nothing more than a curious young girl from the bustling city of San Francisco. When her father, a geologist obsessed with the enigmatic power that plagued the region, whisked them away to Quaking Ground, she couldn&rsquo;t have imagined the world she was about to step into. As soon as they arrived, she found herself enveloped in a paradoxical mixture of veiled danger and undeniable fascination.</p><p>With her father&rsquo;s research center located at the outskirts of the town, Lyra soon discovered that many of the locals avoided venturing near the imposing and eerily silent &ldquo;Screaming Rocks,&rdquo; a cluster of jagged black obsidian formations that bordered the property. Their superstitions and mysterious lore spiced up her otherwise bland and scientific stay, but Lyra ignored them as mere products of mankind&rsquo;s feeble attempts to cope with nature&rsquo;s might.</p><p>In her naivety, Lyra treated Quaking Ground as if it were some grander version of her ordinary city but celebrated with an unparalleled view of the Pacific Ocean. However, her blissful ignorance faded with each rumble that shook the ground beneath her feet and with the unfathomable stories whispered among the townspeople. The earthquakes were eerily predictable, like clockwork, and grew more violent each time.</p><p>Upon completing her daily chores, Lyra would wander the Squeaking Ground&rsquo;s nearby ancient caves, filled with the tragic remains of some unknown civilization. In one particular cave, she stumbled upon a hidden chamber covered in a layer of calcite formations. With the moon as her guide, Lyra traced her fingers along the cold stone, sparkles of calcium dancing in her beams. But as she delved deeper into the chamber, the ceiling slowly began to close in, foundations trembling, preparing to suffocate the unwary.</p><p>Panicked, Lyra scrambled back through the cave. Just as the roof collapsed above her, she barely dodged the impending avalanche of falling rock and dust. She tumbled outside, gasping for breath, while the deafening crash reverberated throughout the terrain.</p><p>Her screams were swallowed by the relentless cacophony, and it wasn&rsquo;t until she caught sight of distant lightning that she realized the sun had given way to the following day. With nothing but shrapnel-sized rocks and lacerating thorns from the dense foliage for comfort, Lyra&rsquo;s vibrant adventure extinguished more quickly than it had ignited.</p><p>As tears stung her eyes and blood flowed down her scraped limbs, there amongst the mocking laughter of the Screaming Rocks, Lyra&rsquo;s resolve solidified. These tragedies weren&rsquo;t products of mere coincidence. The cryptic event which had befallen her that night would linger in her psyche for the rest of her days.</p><p>It became her mission to delve deeper into this new world she had been thrust into, culminating with a revelation about the earthquakes. She became obsessed with piecing together the jigsaw of clues scattered amongst ancient cave paintings and sunsets that mirrored the terracotta hues of the &ldquo;Screaming Rocks&rdquo;:</p><p>Wahulla, the primordial spirit of Earth&rsquo;s volatility, cast restlessness forming tremors… A tempest brewing beneath the blistered land…</p><p>Lyra couldn&rsquo;t believe that her father&rsquo;s research hadn&rsquo;t uncovered these enigmatic secrets either. She couldn&rsquo;t understand why he had been so fixated on their true intentions, instead of acknowledging the mystical interaction between the Earth and the people of Quaking Ground.</p><p>Her revelation during an earthquake changed everything. Lyra watched in horror as shadows danced wildly, merging with the flickering city lights on the horizon. In the company of a shaking ground, she soon made a terrifying discovery. While the tremors had always been aligned to the phases of the moon, the screams of the monstrous boulders now echoed a steady tempo: the beat of her heart.</p><p>Unable to contain her newfound knowledge, Lyra confided in Jamie, a native Quaking Grounder who had been charmed by her enigmatic spark. It was only by hearing the ghastly tale recounted by a stranger&rsquo;s lips that he realized the weight of his mother’s whispered words about the obsidian giants standing guard.</p><p>Far from the scant wisdom of the ancient scrolls and the bland views of higher education, Jamie had been raised amongst indigo shadows veiled in reverence and quivering whispers. His experiences were a stark contrast to Lyra&rsquo;s, bringing a sense of clarity and understanding to their budding friendship.</p><p>Together, Lyra and Jamie ventured heedlessly into uncharted landscapes and an intricate web of rumors hidden in the very roots of Quaking Ground. With his guidance, she learned to decipher minuscule signs of change - ordinary quakes and they could also predict cataclysmic tremors.</p><p>Although skeptical at first, she grew to understand that they were part of something ancient and powerful. Their connection transcended the typical student-teacher relationship, and, in due time, Lyra found herself completely engulfed in their folkloric traditions and cryptic ceremonies.</p><p>Her father&rsquo;s research began to alter under her inspiration, forcing them to face a moment of truth. Bracing themselves for his wrath, they revealed their findings to him. At first, he was deeply troubled, even afraid. However, over time, Lyra and Jamie brought him closer to understanding their unique, melded world.</p><p>A singular ray of hope emerged from darkness as Lyra, Jamie, and her father joined forces to build a life together within Quaking Ground - a new community that encouraged love and understanding between the mystical and the mundane. While the unsolved mysteries that lingered in the shadows continued to inspire a heavy sense of fear in their hearts, their unyielding devotion to understanding the nature of the great Wahulla would remain as strong as the Earth itself.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://stories.googlexy.com/categories/disasters-and-catastrophes/>Disasters and Catastrophes</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stories.googlexy.com/quake-of-fate-when-the-ground-split/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Quake of Fate: When the Ground Split</span>
