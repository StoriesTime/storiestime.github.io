Her guitar case, scuffed and plastered with stickers from journeying through countless small towns, held more than just strings and wood—it held years of hope and struggle.</p><p>The night was electric, flooding every corner of the vast theater. Despite the pounding heart and clammy palms, Luna’s fingers found their rhythm. Each chord she played was a thread weaving her into the tapestry of the music world.
